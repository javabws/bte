	<h3>8. Three Signal Strategy</h3>
	<p>This strategy uses two Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), one with a period of 7, the other with a period of 26; Relative Strength Index (RSI), with a period of 14, which is used as default in MetaTrader 4; and the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) indicator with parameters 12, 26, 9.</p>
	<p>It would be wrong to start trading on the basis of this strategy without being acquainted with the applicable indicators in it.</p>
	<h4>RSI Signals</h4>
	<p>Relative Strength Index is an oscillator and a leading indicator. It is the oscillator because its values range from 0 to 100. It will never rise above 100 and will not drop below 0, but the most important levels are between 30 and 70.</p>
	<p>As soon as the RSI rises above 70, we believe the currency pair is overbought and expect prices to fall; if the RSI falls below 30, we believe the currency pair is oversold and expect prices to increase.</p>
	<h4>MACD and EMA Signals</h4>
	<p>First, let's apply the indicator to the chart in the trading platform, MetaTrader 4. We recommend you buy the Call option if the 7-period EMA crosses the top of the 26-period EMA; RSI must be above the level of 50 (this is not the level of standing by default, so you have to put it on your own).</p>
	<p>MACD should go up. Definitely, you need to detect all three of these conditions. Perhaps these signals were received simultaneously, so you'll have to wait. </p>

	<p>In order to buy the Put option, it is necessary that the 7-period EMA crosses the 26-period EMA downstream and the RSI is below 50 (apply this level yourself). MACD should go down. Definitely, you need to detect all three of these conditions. </p>
	<p><img src="images/strategy/stra88.jpg"/></p>
	<p>Level 50 of the RSI indicator is often considered a confirmation of the trend, and if we enter into a transaction based on the breakdown of this level, we can be sure that we will go in the direction of the trend.</p>
	<p>Since level 50 is not absolutely accurate confirmation of the trend, we except it use two verification indicators (EMA crossing and MACD).</p>
	<h4>Because this strategy involves three conditions for entry into the transaction, it protects us from many false signals and generates very accurate signals.</h4>
