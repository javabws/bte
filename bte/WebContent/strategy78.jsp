	<h3>78. Tunneling binary option trading strategy</h3>
	<p>Tunneling strategy is simple to use and highly effective. This type of strategy is based on a moving averages intersection. It is available for use on all types of currency pairs. Signal for purchase and sell implementation calculated by schedule with any time frames.
In order to see buy or sell signals, this strategy used a number of different instruments. EMA or exponential moving average is one of these tools. The frequency of EMA is 18 and the color of the line shown on the chart is red. The next tool is weighted moving average, also known as WMA, with a periodicity of 12. This moving average is colored in yellow. Third and final tool is the RSI indicator with a periodicity of 21.
Two moving averages with frequencies 18 and 28 form a tunnel, consisting of two red lines. They help to define the beginning and end of the trend.
Weighted averages at intervals of 5 and 12 shows the time in which you need to start trading. Also you can determine the currently active trend using these lines.
You need to consider a few rules in order to make a deal. You can only make purchases or sales of binary option at a time when the tunnel formed by the red lines will be crossed or shrink so that the lines almost merge into one.
The acquisition of call binary option is possible when weighted averages (WMA), with the periodicity of five and twelve, cross the tunnel formed by EMA moving averages. The signal for the purchase will come at a time when the weighted moving average with the frequency of 5 crosses sliding WMA, which frequency is twelve.
A good moment for purchase put binary option will come when the weighted moving averages with intervals of five and twelve cross the channel formed by EMA moving averages. Also, a sell signal will appear at the time of moving WMA with a periodicity of five crosses the line with a periodicity of twelve from top to bottom.
You should also pay attention to RSI indicator, which frequency is twenty-one. You can sell a binary option at the moment when the indicator is below fifty, and should buy when the RSI is above that mark.</p>
