	<h3>What is binary options trading?</h3><br>
	
	<p>Binary options are a simpler, quicker way to earn profit speculating on the financial markets than trading through a stock broker, spread betting, or contracts for difference.
Like all options, binary options are always based on an underlying instrument or asset which you choose, from currencies, stocks, commodities, or indices. Once you pick an asset to trade, you decide whether you think the asset's market price will move higher or lower than its current price by the expiry time you select, from one minute away up to one hour away
	</p>
	
	<h3>How is trading binary options superior to spread betting?</h3><br>
	
	<p>Compared with spread betting, trading binary options has the specific advantages that you have a fixed risk without managing stop loss orders, your profit level is known in advance, and that you choose in advance the expiry time for the option contract. With spread betting, your exposure to loss is not limited to the trade stakes whereas with a binary options trade you cannot lose more than the trade stakes so your exposure to loss is limited. For a more complete comparison between spread betting and binary options trading please see Binary Options vs Spread Betting

	<h3>How is trading binary options superior to traditional trading methods?</h3><br>
