	<h3>94. Candlestick-Inverted Hammer</h3>
	<p>This candlestick pattern can be found at the end of downtrends and it will indicate us a potential reversal of the prices .In other words it gives us a bullish signal .As I stated in the previous sections, this candlestick formation is useful but even if it provides us a bullish signal, we must confirm it first before entering to a trade.
	As with the shooting star formation, the inverted hammer will indicate that the open, low, and close of the session were at a very similar level .The upper wick should be at least twice the length of the candlestick real body. You can see this in the next picture:</p>

	<p>The strength of the signal in inverted hammer will vary; when the inverted hammer's low and open prices are the same, this will be a stronger bullish signal than when the inverted hammer's low and close prices are the same.
	If we find this formation after a long downtrend the inverted hammer will be a strong bullish signal because the prices hesitated in their move downward and increased considerably during the session .After this happened, the bears made a comeback and pushed the prices back near the open .The fact that the prices could increase considerably during this session shows us that the bulls were testing the strength of the sellers. The next session candle will let us determine if this implies a price reversal and the end of the downtrend or if the bears still have the strength to resume the previous downtrend. In the next picture you can see an inverted hammer after a bullish downtrend indicating a reversal:</p>

	<p>If we find a inverted hammer after a downtrend that has been progressively weakening during the previous trading sessions of the active and the next day candle is long and white, we should consider buying a Call in our binary options trading and of course together with other technical tools</p>
