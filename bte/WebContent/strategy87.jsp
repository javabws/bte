	<h3>87. Economic News Trading Strategy</h3>
	<p>Trading needs to take into consideration both technical and fundamental analysis. it is time to take a look and see what is fundamental analysis and how can a trader make the most out of it.
Markets are also moving based on the economic news that are released on a timely basis. When trading binary options based on a currency pair, then it should be considered that the currency pair is actually represented two different economies. For example, the EURUSD pair, the most traded currency pair of them all, it is also moving based on the differences between the US and Euro zone economies, so analyzing and interpreting those economies is something that traders do in order to have an educated guess about future price movements the EURUSD pair makes.</p>
	<h4>What is Economic Calendar?</h4>
	<p>The economic calendar is a clear schedule, known in advance and it is free to be found on the Internet as many websites are offering it. Just to name to, go and look for the economic calendar on www.forexfactory.com or www.dailyfx.com and you will see that they are free to use.
This calendar is easy to use and interpret the data as it has clear rules showing: the time the economic news is released; the currency that is going to be affected; the standard interpretation (how should the currency move based on the actual news that is released); the importance of the economic release; the history of the economic release as a trader can go back in time, more than two years of data being shown. This way a chart can be plotted and identified possible tops or bottoms in a trend, growth or weakness as well.</p>
	<h4>Economic Calendar Study Checklist</h4>
	<p>There are a lot of things to look at when studying the economic calendar and the following list should be a check list with the most important ones:
1.Firstly, there is the date that the trader is interested in as the economic calendar is not only showing the economic events that are supposed to be released in the future but also the previous ones. So, if interested in finding a trend or what the previous data was and looking for a comparison then you can select the period.
2.Secondly, there is nothing more important than knowing which currency is influenced. If the news is coming out of Eurozone, then the Euro is going to move much so look for the Euro pairs to move the most. If the news is coming out of Australia, then Australian dollar pairs are going to be more active. If the news on the other hand is coming out of China, then still the Australian dollar is influenced the most as it is a well-known fact that Australian exports are going mostly in China.
3.Thirdly, the next thing to look at is of course the previous release, then the forecasted value to be released and of course the actual. The trading part is made at first by trading algorithms or expert advisors and then by real traders, humans. If the actual is bigger that the forecasted values, then that are bullish for the currency and depending on the currency pair that is traded, call or put options can be traded.

	<h4>Market Events around Specific Equities</h4>
	<p>For the equities, there are the classical economic news that influence price action at the macro level but one can also look when internal news of a specific company is released. I am talking about finding when earnings are released and when important information, as well as press conferences is scheduled. This should prove to be vital for trading in general and for setting the expiration date of an option as well. For the oil market, the same economic calendar is providing info related to the levels of oil inventories and it is well known the inverse relationship between inventories and production levels.
	If inventories are rising more than expected, it is being said that they are building up and this is bearish oil as this shows less demand. One can trade directly put options on the oil product or, if the oil asset is not being offered by the binary options broker, then trading Canadian dollar currency pairs is the way to go as the CAD is linked to the oil market.
	So, on the example from above, higher inventories should lead to lower oil prices and lower CAD, so call options on the USDCAD pair can be traded. 
	A simple strategy to follow base on the news is, upon the news release, we will know the direction of the market whether it is UP or DOWN. The moment the result is out the market will move in either 1 direction for at least a minimum of 10-15 minutes. This is when we will grab the opportunity in a 60 seconds trade, going in 1 direction an use any one of the martingale strategy given earlier.
	Take note that this strategy has a very high strike rate</p>
	<p><b>Please take note that most of these systems will only make money with BTX 60 seconds time frame which is a 90% payout. Trade among traders and eliminate the brokers</b></p>
