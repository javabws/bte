	 <h4>Judging by the name, this group of indicators helps you follow the trend and stay with it is as long as it is unfolding. Under this sub-chapter will try to introduce to you three trending indicators, being considered one of the most popular trending indicators out there: Bollinger Bands, Commodity Channel Index (CCI), and Moving Averages:</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Bollinger Bands: coming from John Bollinger, this popular indicator takes the shape of a "channel"" on your screen, a channel in which price is traveling, and having 3 components: upper Bollinger band, middle Bollinger band and lower Bollinger band. The middle one it is usually a simple moving average, of 20 period as a default setting, or sometimes instead of a simple moving average an exponential one is being used. Standard interpretation is that as long as price stays between the middle and the upper Bollinger band, trend is bullish and price should go up. When looking to buy dips then a testing of the moving average should be the signal. Opposite for a trend to the downside. As long as price stays between the middle and lower Bollinger band, trend is bearish and price should go down. When looking to sell pullbacks, wait for the middle band to be reached</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Commodity Channel Index (CCI):this is a common tool for traders trying to identify a trend and stay with it. Default levels for it are -100 and 100 levels, but actually the indicator travels a lot below/above those levels and depending of the type of strategy a trader has, this one might be used for identifying divergences between price and it and/or buying/selling extreme lows/extreme highs. </h4>
	 
	 <h4>Moving Averages: every trader out there uses moving averages, or at least at the beginnings they were definitely in the trading tools being used. Their greatest advantage is the fact that are extremely visual and easy to understand, coming in the form of simple moving average or exponential, as being the most popular forms. What to look for when using moving averages is the moment two different averages of different periods are crossing, a couple of examples being presented on the recording.</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">2-	Oscilators - Williams Percentage Range, Ichimoku Kinko Hyo & Relative Strength Index</h3>
	 
	 <h4>There are a lot of oscillators out there, virtually hundreds of them, and more are being created\developed\invented on a constant basis. Metatrader platform is offering a wide variety of them, and the most popular are being presented here. I do believe that each trader should find what works best for his/her trading style and while it is impossible to look at all the indicators/oscillators out there, trying to pick the ones that fit your needs is best. In our case here, we're gonna take a look at Williams Percentage Range, Ichimoku Kinko Hyo and Relative Strength Index (RSI):</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Williams Percentage Range: this oscillator travels only in negative territory, having values between 0 and -100, and it's standard interpretation is that as long as it stays above or close to -20 level, price is in a bullish stance. The opposite is true as well, as long as it stays below or close to -80, price is in a bearish stance. </h4>
	 
	 <h4>Ichimoku Kinko Hyo: this oscillator has it's origin in the Japanese technical analysis branch, and now it is being widely used all over the world. It means in a rough translation, equilibrium at a glance, because, starting from current price, the oscillator is taking into consideration the last 26 periods in the history to project important resistance and support for the next 26 periods. Great oscillator, extremely visual because of the famous cloud component (Kumo), can be applied on a variety of trading strategies.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Relative Strength Index (RSI): one of the most famous oscillators out there, personally being a big fan of it.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Standard interpretation is that above the 70 level price is considered to be overbought, so short signals to be identified, and below the 30 level price is considered to be oversold, so long signals to be identified. </h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">3-	Applying Indicators On A Chart</h3>
	 
	 <h4>Metatrader allows you to put more than one indicator on a chart, you may try with several, but depending on the type of the indicator, it might be one that goes in the indicators window, meaning to the downside of the screen, like relative strength index (RSI) or it may be applied directly on the candles, like moving averages, bollinger bands, etc. The more indicators you place on your chart, the smaller the price window becomes.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>You can choose your indicator from the Insert tab on top left of the Metatrader platform, then choose the Indicators tab, and after you pick one and click ok, the indicator it is on your chart. This is one way how to do it. The second option that you have is to click and drag an indicator after you open the Navigator tab, just pick one indicator and click and drag it over your chart. The click and drag option is valuable because you can actually place two indicators on the same indicator's window.</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">4-	Fibonacci Retracement</h3>
	 <h4>Fibonacci retracement/expansion is extremely important tools for trading financial instruments and as such, there are many strategies that use them. Coming from the great mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci, the famous number series is both additive, as each number is the sum of the previous two, and multiplicative, as each number approximates the previous number multiplied by the golden section ratio.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Technical analysis would be less exact of a science without the Fibonacci sequence, and Metatrader platform offers a dedicated tab for the Fibonacci Retracement, Time Zones, Fan, Arcs, and Expansion. For the purpose of my analysis, I am going to introduce to you the most important and widely used ratios, the retracement and expansion.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Fibonacci retracement is used in finding support/resistance areas/levels when traders try to either buy the dip/sell the spike, that is finding better places to enter/re-enter a trend at lower/higher levels, or in identifying the possible turning point in a downward/upward trend. It is being widely used on all time-frames, so even if you're a scalper that looks only at smaller time frames like 1 minute chart, you'll still find this tool extremely useful. It is being extremely useful for those who analyze charts using Elliott waves theory, as the relationship between the difference waves is highly based on different Fibonacci retracement levels and depending on the retracement level, waves can be classified accordingly.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>The most important levels used in technical analysis are the 38.2%, 50% and 61.8% retracement levels. Depending on what you are using the Fibonacci retracement tool for, there are different levels of importance according to the strategy a trader uses, and here are a couple of examples: if you count waves using Elliott Waves Theory, then the 61.8% and 31.8% levels are mostly used, because they may signal the end of a possible second wave correction, respectively a third wave correction; if you think price is consolidating in a contracting triangle, for example, then look for retracements higher that 71.8% as legs of a triangle are retraced a lot; if you for whatever the reason use some sort of harmonic patterns, then you should look for 78% retracement level as being the most watched for traders using this kind of patterns</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">5-	Fibonacci Expansion</h3>
	 
	 <h4>If Fibonacci retracement tool it is mainly used in identifying better places to get into a trend, namely buying dips or selling spikes, the expansion tool helps traders identify possible targets, project future price movements, adapt Elliott Waves Theory relationships between different waves, basically setting up a path for what values to come next.</h4>
	 
	 
	 <h4>Elliott waves theory, just to give you an example, places a lot of emphasis on the Fibonacci expansion tool, as according to the theory, a classical five waves up sequence needs to have at least one extended wave, and that means 161.8% extension of the previous wave as a minimum target.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Another example on how to apply this tool comes in handy when you want to identify relationships between different movements price makes on market. For example, if you think that price are making a correction now, and looking for better levels to sell the market, than you might look at the previous move that started the correction and applying the expansion tool trying to find the place the correction ends.</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">6-	Double Top Double Bottom</h3>
	 
	 <h4>Double tops/double bottoms fall into the reversal patterns category and are closely monitored by traders. Let's say you are bullish on a pair and price just keeps falling. However, you are bullish based on your fundamental analysis or your technical analysis on a higher time frame. So you are looking for clues price might turn, hence you are looking for reversal patterns. Double tops and bottoms are considered to be a reversal patterns, that is price reverses previous trend and is set to start a new trend in the opposite direction. A double bottom takes the shape of a big W and a double top of a big M. The minimum objective for a double top is the height from the top projected downward from the breakdown point. Opposite for the double bottom pattern, as it is a mirror image for the double top.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>One thing to keep in mind is that a return move (re-test) to the breakout point is more common at double bottoms than double tops.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Depending on the time frame the pattern is forming, it can be traded both on an intra-day basis as on a medium/long term basis, as these patterns come with a measured move, meaning there is a target associated with their shape</h4>
	 	 	 
	 <h4>From my experience when you have a double top or double bottom formation and the top or bottom is by the pip, meaning the values are exactly the same, this is a sign the pattern would not hold and probably it would be broken. Reason for that is currency markets are a stop loss driven markets most of the time and it is not uncommon for price trying to take a level, only to reverse sharply after the level being broken. So look more for the area signaled by the double top or bottom formation than at the exact level it appears.</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">7-	Head And Shoulders</h3>
	 
	 <h4>Head and shoulders and inversed head and shoulders are reversal patterns and they are one of the most common reversal patterns that can be seen on virtually any currency pair and time frame.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>They are having three components, a head and two shoulders, the left and the right one. Shoulders are consolidation area price makes before a spike (and the spike usually is the head) and after it. A line (not necessarily horizontal, as currency markets often give heretic moves due to it being driven mainly by news flows/algorithms trading/high frequency trading) drawn from the top of the left shoulder until the top of the right shoulder in case of an inversed head and shoulders pattern it is being called neckline and this is the line that defines the whole pattern. Measured move for the head and shoulders pattern is the distance price travels from the top/bottom of the head, meaning the spike for the head, till the neckline, projected after the neckline is being broken. </h4>
	 
	 <h4>A couple of examples of head and shoulders and inversed head and shoulders patterns are being presented on the recording that goes with this sub-chapter as well as how to correctly draw a neckline and project the measured move of the pattern.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>One important thing is that usually after the neckline it is being broken, a re-test is coming. But this is not mandatory and often traders wait for the neckline to be re-tested only to find out this would not come. However, this does not invalidate the pattern.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>As a trick/tip to take with you for this pattern, look for the head and shoulders pattern that show a correlation (time, amplitude, severity of the move, demand levels, etc) between the two shoulders to be the most powerful patterns, regardless the time frame.</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">8-	Rising Wedge; Falling Wedge</h3>
	 
	 <h4>A rising wedge is bearish and a falling wedge is bullish. At least this is what the theory says. I agree, however, with one big amendment: rising or falling wedges are not reversal patterns. A conservative approach when trying to actually trade such patterns would be to try to look for 50% retracement after the wedge is being completed as this being most common target for them.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>The reason why these wedges are so important is they are to be found, according to Elliott Waves Theory, either to the beginning of a new move or the ending of an old one. So they may signal the end of a trend or a beginning of a new one, and this is the reason why they are not considered reversal patterns.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>A rising wedge may take the shape of a leading diagonal, and in this case it is just the beginning of a move, with more to come into the same direction. In this case, even if the shape of the entire move is the one of a wedge, after the 50% retracement usually a powerful move comes, and this is a 3rd wave type structure for the Elliott waves fans, meaning price will likely accelerate strongly in the original direction. The same pattern, a rising wedge, may signal the end of a leg to the upside, and this structure it is being called and ending diagonal.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>While ending diagonals are clearly topping formations, the measured move for the wedge it is still the same, namely 50% of the structure after the upward trend line it is being broken
A falling wedge following a downward move may signal a reversal potential and most important is to wait for the trend line between the 2nd wave and the 4th wave to be broken. This is a signal. It's the same for rising wedges in an uptrend.
	 </h4>
	 <h3 class="green">9-	Contracting Triangles</h3>
	 
	 <h4>Contracting triangles are extremely common formations for the currency markets and they can be both continuation patterns as well as reversal ones. They can be symmetrical or ascending/descending triangles. </h4>
	 
	 <h4>A symmetrical triangle can be a continuation pattern when it is forming a correction of a 4th wave type according to the Elliott Wave Theory (which we will cover a couple of chapters later) and that means price has the tendency to exit the pattern into the same direction it originally entered. The same symmetrical triangle can be a reversal pattern when it is ending a complex correction of a previous wave of a higher degree, based on Elliott teachings, and in this case the price has the tendency to exit the pattern in the opposite direction than it originally entered. For both cases, there are two ways to take a measurement from a symmetrical triangle: one would be to take the height of the first wave (which is always the longest one in a contracting triangle) and project that vertical distance from the breakout point, and the second way would be to draw a parallel line upward from the top of the first wave/swing, parallel to the lower line in the triangle, and when it is being hit you have your measured move. </h4>
	 
	 <h4>A contracting triangle can also be an ascending/descending triangle, and in this case it is only a continuation pattern. The pattern is completed on a decisive close above the upper line, and this line should offer support on any dip after the breakout. The minimum objective is measuring the length of the first leg, which, is the longest one, and project it upward/downward from the breakout point.</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">10-Support And Resistance Levels</h3>
	 
	 <h4>While support and resistance levels do not form a pattern in trading, it is worth including such a subject into this chapter as properly spotted, they can be a valuable tool for traders.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>A great way of identifying support and resistance levels is to try to look on the left side of a chart on higher time frames, ideally higher than one hour chart, and spot past consolidation areas. For example, if you are looking for bearish price action, you are a bear and want to see lower prices, then what you need to do in order to see where price might find some support and might try to correct a bit, you look on the left side of the chart and search for areas where price consolidated on the move to the upside. If you are an Elliott Waves trader, than look at the previous move to the upside corrective waves, namely 2nd and 4th waves areas to provide support also on the way to the downside. The same concept can be used when trying to identify resistance areas, and in this case you look for consolidation areas of a previous leg lower to offer resistance on the move back up. </h4>
	 
	 <h4>Another way to look for resistance and support levels is by using the Fibonacci retracement tool, which is presented in details on the third chapter of this manual. If you are looking for price to retrace a recent move in order to get a better entry level on your trade, then just by taking a Fibonacci retracement tool from the lows to the highs and you will have the areas that might offer support/resistance: 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% retracement of previous wave. For more details regarding Fibonacci please check Chapter 4 of this manual.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>The most important thing to remember when using support and resistance levels are that once a support area/level is broken, than it usually becomes resistance. And the opposite is true as well. Once a resistance area/level is broken, than it usually becomes support.</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">11-Expanding Triangles</h3>
	 
	 <h4>Of all the patterns out there, expanding triangles are the trickiest ones. First, they are extremely rare, even on the currency markets. Second, they are misleading as each leg of the triangle gives the impression this is not a triangle but something else. And third, this pattern creates the illusion the market is breaking out all the time. This is quickly met with a reversal and then the break of a support or resistance level on the other side of the trading range. On the recording that comes for this chapter I will try to illustrate such a pattern and give you some tips and tricks about how to play it.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>A quick difference between a contracting and an expanding triangle is that on the expanding triangle the first leg is the longest, and the following legs have the tendency to exceed the distance traveled by the previous wave. There is no way to anticipate the formation of such a pattern and the tricky part of it comes that each leg makes a new marginal high/low, giving the impression a new trend starts, only for price to reverse strongly in the opposite direction and take the previous highs/lows too. It is a trader's nightmare, but if spotted, it can be extremely rewarding.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Another characteristic for such a triangle is that the last leg of it, which in this case is the longest one, has the tendency to blow off, being much longer in price and time that the other waves.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Moreover, one of the strangest aspects of such a triangle appears to be their lack of numerous Fibonacci relationships between the legs of the triangle.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>The one thing to remember though regarding this pattern is that it appears extremely rare, and usually it is a continuation pattern, despite its apparently random moves.</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">12-Elliott Waves Theory - Short Introduction</h3>
	 
	 
	 <h4>"What exactly is the Elliott Wave Theory? In essence, it is a theory of price movement which states that the price of any given stock/commodity/currency pair in a free market will travel in wave-like advances and recessions, in a semi-cyclical fashion. Simply put, it holds that prices of actively traded securities move in wave-like motions in an alternating pattern that normally involves three steps forward for every two steps back."</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Sounds complicated? Well, it isn't. What I am trying to present you in this chapter is one of the most well known trading theories, developed by Ralph N. Elliott and applied/researched/tried/used by many traders in this world. I actually think there is not one trader that never heard in his trading life about the Elliott theory. Of course it has it flaws and actually there is a saying that if you take a chart and you show it to ten different Elliott waves traders, you will get ten different answers and all are right.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>But exactly this is the beauty of it, as one scenario eliminates another, and so on, so unless you try for a top-down analysis on a currency pair, meaning starting with higher time-frames and ending with the lower ones, you are totally lost.</h4>
	 
	 
	 <h4>In short, Elliott theory deals with a sequence of five waves up, corrected with three waves down. That's it.The complicated part of the theory comes in the form of identifying the cycles/super-cycles/mini-cycles, as each wave of those five to the upside and three to the downside has a structure formed of five waves of a lower degree, respectively five/three waves of the same lower degree. Also there are to be met in here lots of new concepts, like leading diagonals, ending diagonals, zig-zags, double and triple zig-zag, complex corrections, etc. How to properly identify one of the above actually makes the beauty of Elliott Waves Theory.</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">13-Elliott Waves Theory - Impulsive Waves</h3>
	 
	 <h4>Impulsive waves are the thing every trader that uses Elliott wave theory is looking for. More exactly, out of the five waves the impulsive move it is formed, the third one is the most searched for, looked for, desired, hunted, etc. That is because an impulsive move has to respect some rules, and one of the rules states that at least one wave in an impulse needs to be extended.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>We already covered extensions on the 3rd chapter when talking about the Fibonacci extension tool. An extension in an impulse means 161.8% out of the previous wave. Subject to expansions are wave 3, wave 5 and wave 1, in this order. Most common is for the third wave to be extended, and this is most likely 161.8% extension projected from the length of the 1st wave. Second most likely is for the 5th wave to be extended, and in this case the extension goes 161.8% out of the length of the 3rd wave. And third, 1st wave might be extended but then the whole structure would probably take the form of an ending diagonal, where the first wave usually is the biggest.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Another important rule for an impulsive wave is that the third wave can never be the shortest one. If you have count, regardless if to the upside or to the downside and the third wave is the shortest one, than that is not an impulse. Also, if no wave out of a five wave sequence is extended, than that is not an impulsive move either.</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">14-Elliott Waves Theory - Corrective Waves</h3>
	 
	 <h4>Corrective waves are the most troubling and difficult to understand price formations under the Elliott theory. They come is such complex forms, even more on the currency markets, that experience traders still have a tough time dealing with them. It is not uncommon for a corrective wave to take complex shapes, like double or triple zig-zags, especially on the currency markets.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Corrections can have different structures, but mainly a correction it is being viewed as an 'abc' structure that corrects a previous impulsive wave. Well that's the theory, and it's true, but things get complicated when you're facing a correction within a correction. That means you are looking at a corrective move on the one minute chart, for example, that actually corrects another corrective move of a higher degree which is a 5 minutes chart .</h4>
	 
	 <h4>They can take different shapes, like a zig-zag, a flat (running, irregular, common, elongated, etc), double and triple zig-zags, x waves, etc. Corrections are the most difficult waves to label and if you're taking into consideration that actually price is consolidating in more than 60% of the time, you know that if you are trying to apply Elliott waves theory to the currency markets you should expect corrections/consolidations areas all over the place.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Things like retracements, proportions, equality between the legs, severity of the move, alternation, should be well anchored in your understanding of the theory.</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">15-Andrews Pitchfork Short Introduction</h3>
	 
	 <h4>The concept of pitchfork in trading was invented by Dr. Alan Hall Andrews, who, inspired by the work of another great thinker in technical analysis for its time, Roger Babson, explained the mechanism of the median line closely guarded by two parallel lines. These median lines present are being present on all charting software under the name of Andrew's Pitchfork</h4>
	 
	 <h4>The basic principle of Andrew's pitchfork is identifying a set of pivot points, namely three, and project into the future a pitchfork based on those three points. Sounds simple? Well, it isn't that simple, because there's a catch. Exactly how to identify those three pivots is the main problem of drawing the right pitchfork. There are a lot of theories out there showing you how to identify those pivots, but for the purpose of this project I will focus on how to interpret the pitchfork and its components.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>A pitchfork it is being formed of three pivot points, from where the pitchfork it is projected, a median line (ML), an upper median line (UML) and a lower median line (LML). They are going to be explained in more details in the next chapter.</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">16-W.D. Gann</h3>
	 
	 <h4>W.D. Gann was perhaps the most famous traders of all the traders of its time. His legacy to the trading community is so big, and unfortunately so confused, that keeps the intrigue developing from one generation of traders to another. I am using the word confusing because a good part of his work is lost and that keeps traders keep looking for the ""secrets"" of his greatness. He was an active trader/researcher, innovator, and he went back in history searching for price history of the things he traded in order to use the date for projecting future price movements.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Gann was the first one to introduce the time element into the trading concept. He actually believed that time should be treated with the same attention like price when trading. The concept of price and time treated together for forecasting a price of a security was from that moment the holy grail of trading. Not only forecasting a price, but saying when it is more probable to happen has become the dream quest for all traders.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Before using such tools one needs to have a full comprehension about what they mean and what to look for when applying them. Therefore I strongly recommend for you to google  first and try to understand the concept , and then go and search for yourself the 1x1 line.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Gann believed that each security, equity, commodity, currency pair, etc, has its own unique way of developing. So the main move of each of the above it is supposed to be given by the 1x1 line.</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">17-Andrews Pitchfork - Median Line Upper - Median Line Lower - Median Line</h3>
	 
	 <h4>After identifying three pivot points to place the pitchfork, just click on the Insert tab, look for Andrew's Pitchfork button, select it, and then click on the chart on the three points you already selected. The result should be a pitchfork taking the shape of a big channel, with one line in the middle and two parallel lines.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>The line in the middle it is being called the median line. Actually, the essence of a pitchfork resides in its median line (ML) and accompanying lines: upper median line (UML) and lower median line (LML). The median line is virtually the most important one, because without it we would have only a normal channel. It is extremely important for a trader because it has a lot of attributes. For example, the ML has the tendency to attract price. It also can be viewed sometimes as a reversal area, or as an important resistance and support area.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>What traders also do is they take a Fibonacci retracement tool an try to identify 50% and 61.8% retracement of the distance between the median line (ML) and the upper median line (UML) and between the median line (ML) and the lower median line (LML). The reason for that is, depending on the time frame you are using, sometimes price travels between the UML and ML, for example without even touching the lines, and the Fibonacci retracement areas are useful in this case.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>One more important application using Andrew's Pitchfork is to draw a trend line from the beginning of the Pitchfork to the starting point of the LML (in an upward trend) or the starting point of the UML (in a downward trend) and project it into the future. This line it s being called the Shift line, and it's meaning is that as long as it is not broken, the trend will continue.</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">18-Fundamental Analysis / Intraday Trading Tips</h3>
	 
	 <h4>Whenever you look at a currency pair you have to take into consideration, beside technical analysis, the fundamental part. Fundamental analysis is actually quite straight forward and means being aware of the economic context of the two currencies that form the pair, like unemployment rate, interest rate differential, industrial production, capacity utilization, gross domestic product (GDP), consumer price index (CPI = preferred method of measuring inflation), etc, to name only a few.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>However, trading is not about understanding how economies function and what a specific number means for the respective economy, but trying to put that number into perspective and, together with your technical analysis on the pair, trying to analyze the evolution of the currency pair as a whole. For example, as a tip for the future traders to be, be aware that you are not trading a currency, but a pair. In the case of the eur/usd currency pair, you are not trading the euro as a currency, nor the dollar as a currency. But the pair, eur/usd. This is extremely important because, let's say you are bear on the euro. The fundamentals in the Euro zone are so weak and troubles mounting all over the place that it is impossible for the euro to rise. So you sell the eur/usd. Wrong. While you may be right assuming the euro is in a bad shape, and the currency is bearish, but maybe the dollar is even more bearish than the euro. And that would make the currency pair, the eur/usd rise.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>To be successful you need to be updated all the time with what's about to happen on the week in front of you when you are trading. Look at future economic releases that are already scheduled, at the time of the release, at the fixings between the sessions (Asian, European, North American), at option expiries, which happen every third Friday of the month, and if that Friday is a holiday, then on Thursdays, etc. In this way, you will not be surprised by nasty market movements.</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">19-Risk On Risk Off Moves</h3>
	 
	 
	 <h4>Risk on/ risk off is a concept recently adopted for the currency markets, to be more exact since the financial crisis started in late 2008. In order for you to understand what it means, just to give you an example, think of the fact that if before the crisis, a positive economic data release out of the United States was normally being good for the dollar, meaning the currency will appreciate. And the opposite was true as well. A bad economic release will hurt the dollar. This is not valid anymore.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>With the central banks all over the world involved in stimulating their own economies, the concept of risk on/risk off appeared, and this means a correlated move the financial markets is doing at a certain point of time, regardless of the economic data that is being released.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Risk on/risk off is a concentrated move of different currencies pairs and equities. In a risk on environment, majors like eur/usd, gbp/usd, aud/usd, nzd/usd, and equities move to the upside, and the usd/cad pair moves to the downside. The opposite is valid as well. In a risk off environment, majors move to the downside, equities move to the downside, and the usd/cad moves to the upside.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>The reason for such correlated moves is, on one hand, based on the tight connections between the major countries central banks, under the supervision of Bank of International Settlements (BIS = mother of all central banks) and on the other hand the globalization we are living in making what is happening in China for example to influence heavily the evolution of the aud/usd pair, as almost one third of the Australian exports go to China, to give you just an example.</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">20-Market Geometry</h3>
	 
	 <h4>If history is an indication of what is most likely to happen in the future, then the same concept can be applied when trading financial instruments, currency markets included. Price patterns that happened in the past are likely to repeat in the future. Nothing more the same in trading. And this is when the time element comes into the trading equation.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Trading without taken into consideration the time element is like driving a car without seeing the road. For example, if you are having a head and shoulders pattern with the left shoulder and the head already completed, then looking at the pattern formed on the left shoulder, in terms of how price consolidated in there, the amplitude of the move, the time taken for the shoulder to be completed, etc, and try to apply these elements for the right shoulder, this is being called market geometry. What is happening in the past is likely to happen in the future.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>When you are looking at a support area that it is being hit three times before the area it is being broken, then on a re-test higher at the same area, but this time price coming from the downside it is more likely that it will fail to break the same area on the first two attempts, with chances rising after that proportionally.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>When looking at a diamond formation then after the sharp middle movement, you should take a look at what happened on the left side and project the time on the right side of the sharp movement, and there is your estimated time when price should break that consolidation pattern. This is market geometry too.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>Market geometry works best especially in the case of triangles, contracting triangles to be more exact, when price travels in legs of threes. These legs have the tendency to respect both time and price when being part of a bigger leg of a higher degree triangle.</h4>
	 
	 <h3 class="green">21-Trendlines</h3>
	 
	 <h4>A trend line is a line connecting the top/bottom of a leg with the next higher low, if talking about a move to the upside, respectively with the lower high, if talking about a move to the downside.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>This simple concept is exactly the reason why traders all over the world use trend lines, as even the name suggests something important: trend line = the line of a trend. So, unless the trend line is broken the trend should continue. The trend line is the line of the trend, so if not broken, trend must go on. But such a simple concept gives traders lots of troubles as most of the times it is being wrongly used, interpreted, and drawn.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>From my point of view a trend line should not be fixed, but vary according to what price does. For example, if you're looking at a rising trend, then you should start from the recent low. After price started to rise, wait for the next swing to the downside and draw the trend line only after the recent highs are being taken. Same is valid on the downside. If you are looking at a falling trend, you should start from the recent high, wait for the next swing to come, and after previous lows are being taken, draw the trend line. And this should stay with you until broken. Otherwise, trend still continues and you have no business in looking on the other side of it.</h4>

	 <h4>The purpose of this chapter is to show you the economic releases and news events that affect a currency pair, what to look for and how to interpret them. I will take four currencies, euro, usd, gbp and aud and will discuss each of them separately.</h4>
	 
	 <h4>The euro currency related pairs are highly influenced by the following, in the order of their importance:
interest rate decision;
	 </h4>	
	<h4>European Central Bank (ECB) press conference that follows the interest rate decision;<br>
    GDP (gross domestic product);<br>
    German ZEW Economic Sentiment;<br>
    German IFO Business Climate;<br>
    PMI Services (purchasing managers index);<br>
    PMI Manufacturing;<br>
    unemployment rate;<br>
	consumer confidence;<>
	CPI (consumer price index);<br>
	industrial production;<br>
	other: Euro group meetings, official speeches by ECB members, bond auctions; EU Summit, etc</h4>
	  <h4>These are the main economic events in Europe that you should be aware of and they are being repeated on a monthly basis, with a pre-defined schedule approved. This is not necessarily the order of their importance regarding the economic developments in a region, but it is mainly their classification based on how currency pairs usually react to these releases.</h4>
	  
	  <h3 class="green">23-What Moves A Pair - USD</h3>
	  
	  <h4>Turning to the almighty US dollar and things became more complicated, as the economic releases out of the United States are far more numerous and watched by everyone in the financial industry.</h4>
	  
	  <h4>Here are the main releases that influence the usd related pairs to move:</h4>
	  
	 <h4> FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meetings;<br>
press conference after FOMC meetings, when appropriate;<br>
NFP ( non-farm payrolls);<br>
unemployment rate;<br>
FOMC minutes;<br>
ADP non-farm employment change;<br>
GDP (gross domestic product);<br>
CPI ( consumer price index);<br>
ISM (Institute of Supply Management) Manufacturing;<br>

speeches held by FOMC members - they are being hold on a regular basis, with the calendar being approved in advance;</h4>
<h3 class="green">24-What Moves A Pair - AUD</h3>

<h4>And finally to Australia and beside the regular economic releases out of the continent I would make a special emphasis here for Chinese data to be watched as closely as possible as one third of the Australian exports go to China. So things like trade balance, pmi's, industrial production, etc out of China are of great importance to the aud related currency pairs.</h4>

<h4>What to look for in terms of economic releases out of Australia and with high influence on the aud currency pairs are the following:</h4>

<h4>interest rate decision (cash rate)<br>
RBA (Royal Bank of Australia) rate statement;<br>
monetary policy meeting minutes;<br>

<h3 class="green">26-Preparing The Trading Week</h3>

<h4>On the final chapter of this trading journey I want to insist on a few basic elements which even though may seem simple, in fact, are one of the most important ones in trading: preparing the trading week, the importance of having a plan and, of course, money management.</h4>

<h4>Regardless if you are a scalper, looking for intraday short moves in a currency pair, or a long term trader, looking for big shifts in the price movement, you should prepare your trading week accordingly.</h4>

<h4>First, Saturday should be your only free day. Do nothing, relax, spend time with family and stuff, just enjoy your free time. Because starting with Sunday, you have business to do. Take the economic calendar and check the week in advance. Look at what kind of the releases are going to be made public next week, when, and prepare accordingly. For example, if you are looking at a week in front of you that has both interest rates decisions and non-farm payrolls to be released, than most likely you are having a trading range for the week until the releases, so better not jump aggressively on a trade until appropriate. Then take a summary look at charts for some technical analysis update before Monday is coming. And make sure you check the news stream during the weekend in order to find out if anything happened that might change your trading plan.</h4>

<h4>Second, think of a typical Monday as being one that begins with the London session taking previous Asian session highs/lows and look for price to end in the middle range for the North American session.</h4>

<h4>Third, keep in mind your price is consolidating more than 60% of the time, so when it's time to move, make sure you're not being caught in the wrong direction.</h4>

<h3 class="green">27-The Importance Of Having A Plan</h3>

<h4>It is mandatory to have a plan when trading the currency markets, because foreign exchange markets are full with fake moves, designed only to take out weak bulls/bears, and after you are stopped out, the market just comes to its senses and goes in the initial direction, but without you because you were stopped out.</h4>

<h4>I hear so much about traders who keep their technical analysis charts secret and their bullishness/bearishness bias secret as well. There is nothing more inaccurate. From my experience, human nature is designed in such a way, that even if you tell somebody that we should stay long/short for this and that reason, and even if you present your technical and fundamental arguments for it, you will still be second guessed because there is always another argument to debate your initial statement. But then again, that's the beauty of trading; somebody has to be on the other side of the trade. So I don't mind sharing.</h4>

<h4>I strongly recommend having a plan when trading. Medium to long term one. For example, you are bull on the eur/usd pair. And your target is the price to go up higher than the current price according to your technical analysis and sustained by fundamentals, price should go at that target. Now, in trading there is nothing like a vertical line, price, even if it advances, like our example says, it will not do so in a straight line, but with ups and downs, corrections and impulsive moves. So if you are a bull, then look to buy the dips for specified targets. Keep in mind currency markets are tricky and fake moves are all over the place. Sticking to your plan might save you from being burned or having a margin call on your account.</h4>

<h4>When your target is being reached, don't go short. Look first for reversal patterns like head and shoulders, double tops and bottoms, wedges, etc Wait for confirmation, do not hurry, because tomorrow is a trading day too.</h4>

<h4>And of course while doing all the above, don't forget about money management. You may be right about your price target, but the way the currency pair is getting there may kick you out as easy as nothing, and in this case your safety net is called money management. </h4>

<h3 class="green">28-Money Management</h3>

<h4>There are many books/theories/strategies out there that deal with money management. It is one of the key factors in trading. But I do believe that they vary depending of the type of trader you are.</h4>

<h4>Some traders have no patience. They like to dive into the markets as quick and fast as possible, take their profit and run away. Small profits. Doing this ten times in a trading day and they are profitable as a medium term/long term investor. They need one money management strategy that is definitely different than the one a medium/long term investor has.</h4>


<h4>Other traders use the famous two percent rules. That is, they never risk more than two percent of their account on any given trade. If they are stopped out, they start again, the percentage remaining the same, but this time out of a smaller account size. After all, there's nothing better than a fresh start.</h4>

<h4>And there are traders who use no stop loss. They go into the market and will react when the account balance reach a certain point, mainly hedging loosing positions until market proves the initial direction, and after the pullback, dumping the hedge and going aggressively forward.</h4>

<h4>In my experience, there is no secret formula to money management and no rules written can help a trader. Human nature plays so many tricks on us that what is valid today may seem totally bullshit tomorrow.</h4>

<h4>What I do believe in, is that in order to be successful when trading, you need to know yourself exceptionally well, to be able to react promptly when needed, suffer moderately and enjoy moderately, put passion in what you do, and be patient. Patience always pays. And that is the best money management advice I can give you being totally honest with you.</h4>

<h4>With this our journey comes to an end and while I hope you can find it useful in preparing you for the trading world and opening your appetite for learning more</h4>

<h3 class="green">29-The Top 10 Best Candlestick Patterns</h3>

<h4>There are many candlestick patterns but only a few are actually worth knowing. Here are 10 candlestick patterns worth looking for. Remember that these patterns are only useful when you understand what is happening in each pattern.</h4>

<h4>They must be combined with other forms of technical analysis to really be useful. For example, when you see one of these patterns on the daily chart, move down to the hourly chart. Does the hourly chart agree with your expectations on the daily chart? If so, then the odds of a reversal increase.</h4>

<h4>The following patterns are divided into two parts: Bullish patterns and bearish patterns. These are reversal patterns that show up after a pullback (bullish patterns) or a rally (bearish patterns).</h4>

<h3 class="green">Bullish candlestick patterns</h3>

<p><img src="images/edu1.jpg"/></p>
<h4>Ok, let's begin with the first one...</h4>

<h3 class="green">Engulfing</h3>

<h4>This is my all time favorite candlestick pattern. This pattern consists of two candles. The first day is a narrow range candle that closes down for the day. The sellers are still in control of the stock but because it is a narrow range candle and volatility is low, the sellers are not very aggressive. The second day is a wide range candle that "engulfs" the body of the first candle and closes near the top of the range. The buyers have overwhelmed the sellers (demand is greater than supply). Buyers are ready to take control of this stock!</h4>

<h3 class="green">Hammer</h3>

<h4>As discussed on the previous page, the stock opened, then at some point the sellers took control of the stock and pushed it lower. By the end of the day, the buyers won and had enough strength to close the stock at the top of the range. Hammers can develop after a cluster of stop loss orders are hit. That's when professional traders come in to grab shares at a lower price.</h4>

<h3 class="">Harami</h3>

<h4>When you see this pattern the first thing that comes to mind is that the momentum preceding it has stopped. On the first day you see a wide range candle that closes near the bottom of the range. The sellers are still in control of this stock. Then on the second day, there is only a narrow range candle that closes up for the day. Note: Do not confuse this pattern with the engulfing pattern. The candles are opposite!</h4>

<h3 class="green">Piercing</h3>

<h4>This is also a two-candle reversal pattern where on the first day you see a wide range candle that closes near the bottom of the range. The sellers are in control. On the second day you see a wide range candle that has to close at least halfway into the prior candle. Those that shorted the stock on first day are now sitting at a loss on the rally that happens on the second day. This can set up a powerful reversal.</h4>

<h3 class="green">Doji</h3>

<h4>The doji is probably the most popular candlestick pattern. The stock opens up and goes nowhere throughout the day and closes right at or near the opening price. Quite simply, it represents indecision and causes traders to question the current trend. This can often trigger reversals in the opposite direction. </h4>

<h3 class="green">Bearish candlestick patterns</h3>

<p><img src="images/edu2.jpg"/></p> 

<h4>You'll notice that all of these bearish patterns are the opposite of the bullish patterns. These patterns come after a rally and signify a possible reversal just like the bullish patterns.</h4>

<h4>Ok, now it's your turn! I'll let you figure out what is happening in each of the patterns above to cause these to be considered bearish. Look at each candle and try to get into the minds of the traders involved in the candle.</h4>

<h3 class="green">Kickers</h3>

<h4>There is one more pattern worthy of mention. A "kicker" is sometimes referred to as the most powerful candlestick pattern of all.</h4>

<p><img src="images/edu3.jpg"/></p>
	  
<h4>You can see in the above graphic why this pattern is so explosive. Like most candle patterns there is a bullish and bearish version. In the bullish version, the stock is moving down and the last red candle closes at the bottom of the range.</h4>

<h4>Then, on the next day, the stock gaps open above the previous days high and close. This "shock event" forces short sellers to cover and brings in new traders on the long side.</h4>

<h4>This is reversed in the bearish version.</h4>

<h3 class="green">Should you wait for confirmation?</h3>

<h4>Most traders are taught to "wait for confirmation" with candlestick patterns. This means that they are supposed to wait until the following day to see if the stock reverses afterward. This is absolutely ridiculous!</h4>

<h3 class="green">Do not wait for confirmation!</h3>

<h4> Seriously, think about it for a second. If a stock pulls back to an area of demand (support) and I have a candlestick pattern that is telling me that buyers are taking control of the stock, then that is all the confirmation I need.</h4>

<h4>As a swing trader I have to get in before the crowd piles in, not when they get in! In other words, I want to be one of the traders that make up the pattern itself! That is the low risk, high odds play.</h4>
