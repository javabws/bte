	<h3>68. Roll Back Strategy</h3>
	<p>You should track an asset on 1 minute time frame, if we see three or more consecutive candles of the same color, let's wait for a rollback. We should buy binary option after the completion of the roll back. For example, we see that three white candles closed, new candle opens and it goes in the opposite direction - the price decreases. We wait 1 minute to make and fix it rolled back and buy Put binary options with a term of expiration at the close of the current candle. Buying an option is still recommended in the case when the bodies of three candles together make up more than 10 points.</p>
