	<h3>76. Profit from binary trading in financial crisis</h3>
	<p>For many traders actually, trading on the currency market, crisis and the fall in commodity assets can cause a lot of trouble, and often bring considerable financial losses. The question is: in a situation of total economic instability, when much of the EU countries are on the brink of bankruptcy, the U.S. economy cannot go on the amendment, and the Asian markets suffered significant losses due to the recent earthquake, does it make sense to play on the exchange? How do we make profits during the crisis?
Good news is that in times of crisis you can make money on your own financial market knowledge and minimal understanding of the situation. Binary options trading allow investors to earn the same as in a booming market, and in the moments of its collapse. How is this possible? In binary options trading, investors are invited to make a prediction where the price of their chosen asset will go up or down. Thus, correct forecast of the drop in the market can make the exact same percentage of the investment as well as the rise in the market, and this is not a small percentage - up to 90%.
Take for example the recent tragedy that occurred in Japan - earthquake, tsunami, and then the explosions at nuclear reactors. Because of the massive power outage, the operation in the main Japanese plants was partially suspended or discontinued at all. It was easy to assume that the shares of the largest companies will lose in value, which has really happened. Having to correctly predict this trend, investors have the opportunity to earn up to 90% of the profits from the amount invested in the forecast. That is, if the investor, for example, invested $1,000 and predicted drop in JPY currency, he would have received $1,900 every 60 seconds. Going in to the market 10 times , he would have won 9 times!
Thus, answering the question of whether you can make money during a crisis, we would say that with the advent of such financial instrument as binary options, you can. Most importantly, the right time to respond to events that occur in the market and your success is guaranteed!</p>
<p><b>Please take note that most of these systems will only make money with BTX 60 seconds time frame which is a 90% payout. Trade among traders and eliminate the brokers</b></p>
