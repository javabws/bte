	<h3>90% PAYOUT</h3>
	<p>When brokers advertise a payout rate it does not mean that all assets are offered at that rate. In a case where a trader focuses on a particular trading asset it would pay to shop around for the broker that offers the best payout for that asset. Please take note that most of the brokers do not offer the same payout for all the expiry time frames usually the 60 seconds trade will be the lowest payout, at times as low as 65% to 75%</p>
