	<h3>5. Volume Spread Analysis (VSA) Strategy</h3>
	<p>In this article we going to introduce you and explain you a simple 60 seconds binary options strategy that we use when we want to take 60 seconds trades. The steps of this strategy are really simple. The only indicator we use is a volume spread analysis indicator and no other indicators. I also use the engulfing candlestick pattern. About these two things (VSA and engulfing)  I will give you a brief summary.</p>
	<h4>VSA</h4>
<p>Climax bars</p>
<p>-Red: High volume in a bearish candle, the investors are selling heavily</p>
<p>-Green: High volume in a bullish candle, the investors are buying heavily</p>
<p>-Buying climax at tops  means a possible down movement of the market</p>
<p>-Selling climax at bottoms means a possible up movement of the market</p>
	
	<h4>Engulfing pattern</h4>
<p>-Bullish: After a reversal the new bullish candle engulf the previous bearish candle</p>
<p>-Bearish: After a reversal the new bearish candle engulfs the previous bullish candle</p>

	<p>Now look at the screen shots. In this binary options chart there are three ITM setups in the rectangles. The setups are after a reversal in a resistance or a support. In the reversal we have engulfing patterns and in the volume the new bearish candle has more volume than the previous bullish candle. If these two things to happen (engulfing, more volume in the reversal candle) it's very possible the next candle to close below the reversal bar. We are working in 1min chart and the expiry of the trades is 1 minute (60 seconds).</p>

	<p>We have the same situation in this chart. Engulfing patterns near a support or a resistance and the reversal bearish candle has more volume than the previous bullish candle.</p>
	<p>Some things to avoid:</p>
<p>-If in the reversal we will have an engulfing pattern with buying or selling climax (green or red bar in the volume) it's better to not take this trade.</p>
<p>- If  we have strong volume and buying or selling climax in the resistance or the support it's better to not take a 60 seconds trade because the market maybe will move unpredictable</p>
<p>- I prefer reversals without buying and selling climax</p>
<p>- Don't overtrade and don't martingale</p>
	
	<p>This setup above can give you solid trades if you follow the rules because it's about human psychology with the volume and the price action. </p>
	<p><b>Please take note that most of these systems will only make money with BTX 60 seconds time frame which is a 90% payout. Trade among traders and eliminate the brokers.</b></p>
