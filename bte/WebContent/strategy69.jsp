	<h3>69. Triangle Breakthrough Strategy</h3>
	<p>Triangles are different, but they all show the imminent breakthrough price.
 Some of them - are rising, portend the imminent increase in prices and a break up, but falling triangles, on the contrary, are harbingers of its likely fall.
 Accordingly, traders have to trade on an increase or decrease of the price when you see that the chart has formed the corresponding figure.

	<p>In an uptrend, price movement forms the ascending triangle. 
To see it, trade should visually draw two lines through the points of resistance and support. Resistance line (higher) must be horizontal and support line is located at an angle thereto. It is obvious that in a downtrend, traders have to look for a downward triangle.
 In descending triangle, support line is horizontal, resistance line disposed at an acute angle to it - on sinking maximum points.
