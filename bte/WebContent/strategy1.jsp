	<h3>1. Staking Up Plan For A 90% Payout</h3>
	<p>To succeed with this strategy you will need to do some math calculations on your investments and profits. You have to think fast because the market is volatile and situation changes in minutes. Prepare yourself for losses as they are part of the game but if you are experienced enough you will always be on profit. Please take note the below calculation is strictly for a 90% payout</p>
	<h4>The strategy method</h4>
	<p>The method on this strategy- is based on a math formula that guarantees profits even when your trades expire out of the money. When you decided trading 60 seconds binaries you should have already considered how to deal with losses. I have been trading for some years now and the following strategy is proven to be working.</p>
	<p>So what is the idea behind  if you win keep trading on the same stake -hen you lose move to the next level. The first investment would be $10 with a 90% return so a successful trade will bring me $9 profit.</p>
	<p>90% is a standard payout which BTX pays on 60 seconds trading</p>
	<table class="table table-bordered textcenter_align" >
		<tr>
			<th>This is the level table if you lose:</th>
			<th>Your nett profit if you win:</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td> $10  </td>
		<td> $9</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td> $13 </td>
		<td> $1.70 </td>

	<p>The asset's price always change (Up/Down) so you just need to keep trading in one direction (High or Low) and a successful trade will follow. Even if you lose 5 trades in a row, you will make $50 net on your 6th attempt.</p>
	<p>Maximum 6 times in a row, if no winners you have to stop and accept losses</p>
	<p>Start back all over again from the beginning and you will cover your losses in no time</p>
	<p>It is very unlikely to lose 6 times in a row when you pick one of our free strategies which is given</p>
	<p><b>Please take note that most of these systems will only make money with BTX 60 seconds time frame which is a 90% payout. Trade among traders and eliminate the brokers.</b></p>
