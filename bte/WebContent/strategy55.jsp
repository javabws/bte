	<h3>55. Awesome Oscillator binary options strategy</h3>
	<p>Awesome Oscillator is an excellent tool for trading binary options, which allows you to pre-define a trend reversal. Awesome Oscillator binary options strategy is used with all assets at all time intervals. Most often, Awesome Oscillator binary options strategy is used for 60 seconds options because, on the 1-minute chart, trends change often. Moreover, Awesome Oscillator helps not only to identify trend reversal but also to choose expiry time.
Awesome Oscillator is very similar to the MACD indicator and also provides signals of reversal, but the difference is that the indicator counts median prices instead of close prices.
This indicator is also called a magic oscillator. It is used to determine the relationship of the driving force of the market in the short term and the driving force in the long term. The indicator is also formed around a zero level, and it has fixed slip values.

	<p>6. The appearance of the second local maximum in the histogram, which is lower than the previous and is also above the zero level, indicates you should buy a PUT option. The appearance of the third local maximum, which is lower than the second, confirms the signal.</p>
