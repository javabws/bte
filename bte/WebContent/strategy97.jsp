	<h3>97. Candlestick-Dark cloud Cover</h3>
	<p>This candlestick pattern provides us with a bearish reversal pattern signal. This pattern has two components: a bullish candle representing a trading period session, and a bearish candle representing the next period trading session. The bearish candle closes below the middle of the first candle (below 50%).The price gaps up on the next period, but in the end fills the gap and close into the gains of the previous period. This rejection is a bearish signal, and the retracement into the previous periods gain and adds more strength to it.<br>
