	<h3>7. Three Execution Strategy</h3>
	<p>This is an effective 60 second options strategy - despite its simplicity - because by trading these contracts in sets of three, purchased roughly 10-20 seconds apart, you will ""dampen down"" the inherently volatile and unpredictable nature of such short-dated contracts. It acts as an averaging mechanism that dampens some of that random ""noise"" which can have such a large effect on 60-second contracts. Certainly nothing revolutionary here. Nevertheless, it is effective and we do definitely recommend its use as part of your overall 60 second binary options strategy.</p>
	<h4>Our Simple Yet Effective 60-Second Binary Options Trading Strategy</h4>
	<p>1.	Should be used as part of your overall 60-second trading strategy.</p>
	<p>2.	Each ""series"" trade will consist of three (3) identical contracts, purchased 10-25 seconds apart.</p>
	<p>3.	Each contract in the series should be purchased for the same amount.</p>
	<p>4.	Volatility determines your purchase intervals. As volatility rises, so too should your spacing intervals.</p>
	<p>5.	The default spacing is 10 seconds and should be used the majority of the time.</p>
	<p>6.	When volatility is particularly high (for your chosen asset, not across the board) you should lengthen your intervals to between 15-25 seconds.</p>
	<p>7.	Your intervals should never exceed 30 seconds, as this will allow your 1st contract to expire before your 3rd is even purchased.</p>
	<p>8.	The exact spacing is not critical so long as the above guidelines are strictly followed. As you practice with this method you will get a feel for the spacing under various market conditions and get better at it.</p>
	<p>9.	That's it!</p>
	<p><b>Please take note that most of these systems will only make money with BTX 60 seconds time frame which is a 90% payout. Trade among traders and eliminate the brokers.</b></p>
