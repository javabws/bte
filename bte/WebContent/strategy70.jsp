	<h3>70. Binary Options Ladder Trading</h3>
	<p>What kind of attitude has a ladder to binary options? Ladder binary trading is a kind of binary options trading, where the trader receives several price levels, which are located at an equal distance from each other in the likeness of the ladder. Simply put, binary options ladder indicates the level to which the price of an asset should change for a certain period until the option is active.
This means that the trader must set these levels and time periods. For successful trading, the price should go through these levels as the stairs of the ladder.
In order to trade using binary options ladder, the trader must analyze the market and determine how quotes of currency pair will move during the day, and then select the ladder version in accordance with the appropriate price moving.
For ladder trading, the strategy based on Pivot levels suits the most. To use it, a trader needs to apply these levels on the chart with the desired currency pair using the Pivot calculator. Thereafter, three lines will be visible as a support (S1, S2 and S3) and as a resistance (R1, R2 and R3). 
Let's imagine that USDJPY is trading at 99.75 and you want to use the ladder when trading binary options with your broker. You want to make a trade using a ladder with three price levels: 99.50, 101 and 101.40. How do you need to trade in order to make a profit?
In the settings you need to select the option expiry period firstly, which for example we set at 12.00. 
To analyze how the price will behave during the day, the trader would be preferable to use a time frame M1. You can also build your ladder trading based on Pivot trading levels. As an alternative, you can try to install the ladder by 3 points above respective Pivot levels. In this case, you can be sure that your trading will be successful.
