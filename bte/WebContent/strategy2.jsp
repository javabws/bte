	<h3>2. Support and Resistance Strategy</h3>
	<p>We surmise that the price of assets possess a tendency to advance in a sequence of waves with each wave possessing a top and a bottom. These constraints are assessed to be major reversal levels which can be readily identified by key support and resistance levels. A favorite 60 seconds strategy is to identify those times when an asset price clearly rebounds from these resistance and support levels. New binary options could then be opened in the opposite direction to that in which price was progressing before the rebound.</p>
	<p>For instance, the next GBP/USD 60 seconds trading chart presents good examples about when to execute both CALL and PUT binary options. Essentially, whenever price rebounds against resistance, you should activate a PUT option. Similarly, if price bounces higher after striking support, then you should open a CALL binary option.</p>
	<p>The first step in instigating such a strategy would be to detect a currency pair that has been range-trading for some time and then identify the resistance and support levels by either using a broker's information or simply connecting the highest points for resistances and the lowest values for supports, as shown on the chart below.</p>
	<p><img src="images/strategy/strate2.jpg"/></p>
	<p>Execute some price testing of these levels then wait until the present candlestick confirms a true bounce by cleanly closing below resistance or above support. This action will provide you with some protection against false signals. For example, if a successful confirmation is attained, then open a new PUT binary option using the GBP/USD as its underlying asset with the 1 minute expiry time if price bounds against resistance, as displayed on the chart above.</p>
	<p>By wagering $100 with a payout of 90%, you would have collected $90 for both the PUT options shown above. In fact, your initial wager of $100 would have exponentially increased to a  $1300  for the four trades displayed above within few hours if you had reinvested your returns in each case.</p>
	<p><b>Please take note that most of these systems will only make money with BTX 60 seconds time frame which is a 90% payout. Trade among traders and eliminate the brokers.</b></p>
