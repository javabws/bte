	<h3>75. Price Break Charts</h3>
	<p>A very powerful chart tool and technique to use is price breaks. The Japanese traders invented the price break charts. It was not until 1994 the western world noticed them in the publication of Steve Nilson's book "Beyond Candlesticks: New Japanese Charting Techniques Revealed". For binary option trading it can be extremely powerful to detect the strength of a trend and where it will end.
	Price break charts look like candlesticks without the wicks. You can call them bricks or columns. They are footprints telling you which direction the sentiment is taking. Like candles, they are usually black for down move and white for upward move. If a new low has been reached, a black is added and if a new high has been reached, a white is added. If no changes have occurred, nothing is added.
	One of the most useful aspects of price breaks charts is the clarity of their rules. There is no room for dispute, due to the fact that they operate on close prices.</p>

	<p>The seemingly simple price break charts can be used in a great deal of technical analysis. From the perspective of sentiment analysis, by registering only the occurrences when a price has established a new high or low, the chart is in effect visualizing the persistence of sentiment.
 The prices ability to setting new highs or new lows gives us a way to quantify trends besides the usages of traditional trend analysis.
 From a persistence perspective, the trader can start to quantify how serious a trend is, at what time it is weak and when it has reversed.
Price break charts measure this persistence in an unambiguous way. When using price break charts, traders cannot argue with the price action. 
The price has either succeeded in maintaining higher or lower or it has not. Furthermore, you know in advance where a price break chart would be considered strong enough to break a trend.
