	<h3>6. Dev's Straddle Strategy</h3>
	<p>The Dev's Straddle Strategy is loved by many investors because the profit potential is unlimited.  With the straddle strategy it really doesn't matter if the asset price goes up or down, as with you straddling the price you will make a profit.</p>
	<p><b>Profit:</b> The profit with the straddle strategy is truly unlimited; this is because no matter where the asset price is headed the long positions for both the Call and Put options will provide the necessary cover for profitable trades. All you would need in this type of binary trading is for the price of the asset to move away from the market price at the setup time of the straddle.</p>
	<p>Regardless of the position of the markets, there are enough efficient strategies available with binary options trading to have any investor succeed in their trading. All the binary options strategies are quite sophisticated in their design and approach, but there is however one strategy that is less sophisticated which is known as the straddle. This fact is true because the straddle requires a trader to purchase one Put and one Call in order for the trade to be activated. So let's take a look at this strategy.</p>
	<p>The straddle strategy is achieved by holding the same number of Puts and Calls with the same strike price and expiration</p>
	<p>Therefore the trader can hope to profit irrespective of the movement in the market. The market can move in three different directions Up, Down or Sideways. So for a trader to succeed in an unstable and an unknown market direction, the trader is able to do this:</p>
	<h4>Highly profitable Dev's Straddle Strategy:</h4>
	<p>1-Go to any economic news website and scroll for high impact news 
   on the targeted currency pairs</p>
   <p>2-Pick both sides 15 minutes before the news.</p>
   <p>3-Upon the news release, the market will head in to one direction</p>
	 <p>4-Keep on trading in that direction till a reversal is noticed. Usually you   
   will be able to trade 15-30 minutes with a 85%  of the time winning  	
	 </p>
	  <p>The success with binary trading options depends highly on the strategy that you choose and the decisions that you make. The straddle strategy has been used for many years by successful and aggressive traders around the world. Experts suggest that you use the straddle strategy frequently and make sure monitor the economic news.</p>
	   <p><b>Please take note that most of these systems will only make money with BTX 60 seconds time frame which is a 90% payout. Trade among traders and eliminate the brokers.</b></p>
