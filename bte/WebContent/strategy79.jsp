	<h3>79. Volatility</h3>
	<p>Volatility is a measure of swings in a price action and the rate of change of these swings. A high volatile market has major swings and is considered more unstable. A market with very low volatility is more stable and is less changing.
 It is easier to make bigger profits with relatively less money in a high volatile market as the ROI can be much greater; however, the risk of misjudging the market tremendously is equally higher.
The traders ignoring the volatility conditions of the underlying market is bound to get hurt and it is a recipe for misapplying binary option strategies. Similarly, ignoring high volatility conditions leads to applying inappropriate trading strategies.
You probably guessed it already as we said it before. Beware that extremely high volatility conditions are often a seen as a signal of reversal.
The nature hereof is that extreme volatility reflects transient conditions and the underlying market will return to average ranges of volatility. This event or norm is known as a regression to the mean.
The contrary is likely to take place when there is a low volatility condition which reflects a clustered market that is likely a prelude to a breakout.</p>
