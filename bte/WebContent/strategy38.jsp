	<h3>38. Macd Signal Strategy</h3>
	<h4>How to start your strategy?</h4>
	<p>It is better to start with clear and simple algorithms. MACD - is an indicator based on the calculation of convergence/divergence of MA - moving averages. This is an excellent example of such a trading algorithm.</p>
	<p>Positions of trading system based on MACD indicator are simple enough, but before you start to consider them, it is necessary to identify the key states of the indicator, on which MACD trading is based, the power and receiving signals on binary option buying or to the closure trading.</p>
	<p>The most significant level - is "0" mark, the intersection of its histogram and MACD signal line indicates the beginning of a trend change.</p>

	<p>The MACD histogram is used in order to inform about the magnitude of the movements' momentum - the longer the line - so momentum is stronger. It is also a great reference for closing positions - as soon as the length of the lines begins to decline, it can be assumed weakening trend momentum, and hence its possible reversal.</p>
	<h4>MACD signals</h4>
	<p>MACD signal line performs the function of confirming signal, as usual, it slightly delayed with respect to the histogram. You can adjust the display so that the signal line is crossed "0" only after the close of the regular candles and drawing on the opposite side of zero point.</p>
	<p>But it is not so simple. Competent and lucrative trading on MACD requires the ability to distinguish proven and false trading signals. It's enough to be careful and not trying to maximize profits by any necessary act.</p>
	<h4>Confirmed signals are as follows:</h4>
	<img src="images/strategy/stra388.jpg">
	<p>It requires fixed breakout of mark 0 signal line with a simultaneous drawing of a histogram, which length of lines increases.</p>
	<h4>False signal also has its signs:</h4>
	<img src="images/strategy/stra3888.jpg">
	<p>Trader should closely monitor the signal line - zero mark must be passed without fail. You should enter the market only after closing of the bar which has led to a trading signal appearance.</p>
	<p>Upon confirmation of a trade signal, it is necessary to buy an option in the desired direction.</p>
	<h4>A trader makes his own decision to enter market; in this case MACD trading requires extreme care and compliance with all the rules of the trading system. Observe the conditions described strategy and money management rules - in this case, you can earn a decent income using just one MACD indicator. </h4>
