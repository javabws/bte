	<h4>How to trade Three Indians strategy?</h4>
	<p>In order to use the Three Indians binary option strategy, you can draw a trend line on the chart that will cross the lows (in the case of a negative trend), or highs when the trend is upward. In this case, when the trend line touches the chart for the third time, is a signal to buy binary options.</p>
	<p>In a bullish market, a touching should be at the top. The trend line will act as a resistance level. After the third touch, you can buy a Put option.</p>
	<p>Signals to buy a Call option can be searched at the touch of a trend line, which is held by three lows. Once the price touches the support line for the third time (the trend line in this case acts as support), you can buy a Call option.</p>
	<p>It is important to identify the graphical model on the chart correctly. If the trader makes a mistake, it can lead to the fact that it will suffer losses. Most often traders instead of Three Indians chart pattern identify Head & Shoulders pattern. It is clear that if they took this pattern instead of Three Indians, it will incur a loss as the Head & Shoulders is a reversal pattern that is constructed either on top or on the bottom of the market.</p>
