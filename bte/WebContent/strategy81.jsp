	<h3>81. Buying Call or Put Options on 50% Retracements</h3>
	<p>The 50% retracement level can be a rewarding one if a trader knows what to look for and if the level is associated with a specific trading pattern.
	That being said, there are some important things to consider when trading the 50% level. For example, it is well known that in a contracting triangle, the most common consolidation pattern, it is mandatory for at least three legs of a triangle to retrace minimum 50% and there is a common thing for a horizontal contracting triangle to end around the 50% level.
	Therefore, knowing that and calibrating the expiration minute based on the time frame the pattern appears should give us an important tool for trading binary options with contracting triangles based on the 50% retracement levels.
	Moreover, in an impulsive move, after the first wave, it is common for the second wave to come and retrace 50%-61.8% of the first wave before the extended wave to start, so buying call options in a bullish impulsive move is the way to go, or put options in a bearish impulsive move as well.
