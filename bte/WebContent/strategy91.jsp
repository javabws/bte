	<h3>91. Candlestick- Hammer</h3>
	<p>This candlestick pattern provides us a bullish reversal signal of considerable strength. The lower wick should be at least twice as long as the candle real body .A hammer candlestick will not have upper wick, or it will be very short:</p>

	<p>Basically, the hammer indicates us that in the time frame it represents the open, high and close prices were very similar .The long wick of the hammer pattern tells us that the market "tested" where the support was located, and when this area was found, the buyers pushed the price higher near the open; in other words, the buyers rejected the bears.
	Not all the hammer candlestick formations have the same strength; a hammer candlestick with the same high and close prices will be stronger than a hammer with the same open and high prices. Basically, in the first situation the buyers rejected the sellers and pushed the price past the opening price and in the second one the buyers could counter the sellers, but they could not bring the price to the open level.
	The hammer is a very useful candlestick pattern that will help us to locate support areas. When a hammer appears after a downtrend, it will be providing us a signal of a potential trend reversal and a change in the price movement direction. In the next picture you can see an example of a hammer pattern at the end of a downtrend,followed by a reversal:</p>

	<p>Of course even if the hammer candlestick pattern gives us a strong signal, we need the help of other tools and indicator to confirm this .For example, let's imagine that in a graphic with 1 minute candlesticks we are following a strong downtrend that begins to weaken, and the two last minutes candle are dojis,then a hammer appears .This will most likely indicate a very high probability of trend reversal, so in binary options trading we will buy a Call option.</p>
