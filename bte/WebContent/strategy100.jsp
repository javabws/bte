	<h3>100. Haaresh Heikin Ashi Strategy</h3>
	<p>The Heikin Ashi is not a japanese candlestick pattern, it's a different style of Japanese candlestick calculated differently from the standard ones. The standard candlesticks are formed from the opening price, closing price, high price and low price of a trading session, however, the Heikin Ashi candlesticks are calculated as it follows:<br>
Close = (opening + high + low + close) / 4<br>
Opening = (opening of the previous bar + close of the previous bar) / 2<br>
High = Max (high, opening price, closing price)<br>
Low = Max (low, opening price, closing price)<br> 	
The Heikin Ashi Candlesticks are mostly used to identify trends with ease. White candlesticks without lower wicks are indicating us a strong uptrend, while black candlesticks with no upper wick will indicate us a strong downtrend.
The Heikin Ashi Candlesticks are an effective and useful tool for trend identification, and is one of the many available methods used in conjunction with standard candlestick charts to improve the insulation of prices and try to predict future price movements.
By themselves, the Heikin Ashi candlesticks should not be used as the only factor upon which we base our binary options trading, but they will be especially useful to eliminate market noise and to represent the price action in a smoother way.
The Heikin Ashi candlesticks utilize moving averages in their calculation, which will mean they are a "laggy" indicator by their nature.
One of the ways in which Heikin Ashi candles can be used in our trading with binary options are  buying a Call or Put depending on the color, and once it changes, making a sell back of the option(we will need additional indicators to indicate us if prices reach overbought / oversold territory, as well as 
information on the strength of the trend and its possible weakening, and levels of support / resistance) .On the next graphic you can see the same market conditions being represented by normal candlesticks vs Heikin Ashi candles.

	<p>There are a number of main signals that Heikin Ashi candles can provide:<br>
1.White candles without lower wicks are indicating a strong uptrend.<br>
2.A candle with a small body and upper / lower long shadows indicate a potential change on the direction of a trend.<br>
3.Consecutive black candles indicate a downtrend.<br>
4.Black candles with wicks will indicate a strong downtrend; we will remain trading Puts until the trend changes.<br>
Heikin Ashi candles are generally a great addition to normal candlestick charts, and can help us to find trade opportunities in our binary options trading.

	<h4>Strengths and weaknesses of the candlestick chart</h4>
	<p>If we compare the Japanese candlestick charts with OHLC charts and western line graphs, most binary options traders will prefer to utilize Japanese candlestick in their technical analysis, because they are easier and faster to interpret, and allows us to establish a quick relation between opening and closing prices as well as the highs / lows of the session, and the different conclusions we can draw based on candlestick patterns. Here you can see a basic OHLC graphic and a basic candlestick one:</p>
	<img src="images/strategy/str170.jpg">
	<p>However, like all the tools we can use in our technical analysis and binary options trading, Japanese candles have weaknesses that must be compensated using them in conjunction with other tools. For example, Japanese candlesticks do not reflect events that occurred between the opening and closing of the previous sessions, and although they indicate the high and the low of the session they represent, they do not tell us which one was reached first.<br>
If we compare the Japanese candlestick charts vs the western line charts(OHLC),we can see that their major difference is the way they display the opening and closing prices. The western line emphasizes the difference of the next/previous periods close and open prices, while the candlestick puts all its emphasis on the relation of the closing price with the previous sessions closing price. Identifying a trend or a reversal will be a lot easier if we are using Japanese candlesticks.<br>
The OHLC charts makes us focus on trying to find significant signs of a developing pattern, and this will lead to an extensive research before finally entering a trade. This could be considered one of the strengths of the western line charts, since they will force the trader to analyze carefully the next move.<br>
Chart reading and trading is something subjective, and will depend of each individual trader. Japanese candlestick and OHLC charts are the most used technical analysis graphic systems(however, Japanese candlestick charts are the most popular),that's why I compared them .It would not be a bad idea to use two tabs, one with each chart style, when we are using a web based charting program.<br>
The Haaresh Heikin Ashi strategy is a powerful strategy which you don't have to combine with any other technical tools.<br>
Call or Put just depends on the previous candle. Just follow,<br>
If previous candle is a bear, go for a Put<br>
If previous candle is a bull, go for a Call<br>
As simple as that!!
