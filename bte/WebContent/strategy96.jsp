	<h3>96. Candlestick - Engulfing patterns</h3>
	<p>The engulfing candlestick formation is very similar to the harami with the difference that the first candle of this formation is the small one ,and the second candle the one engulfing it vertically(body and wicks included).<br>
There are two types of engulfing patterns:<br>
The Bearish engulfing pattern consists on a first small bullish candlestick engulfed vertically by a second long black candle. The market gaps up, the bulls push the prices higher but the bears take over and pull the prices down filling the gap and pushing the prices below the previous candle open price.</p>

	<p>The Bullish engulfing pattern consists on a small bullish candlestick engulfed vertically by a second long white candle. The market gaps down, the bears push the prices lower but the bulls take over and are able to pull the prices down, filling the gap and pushing the prices past the previous candle opening price.</p>

	<p>Depending on the kind of binary options you are and the risk you are willing to assume, there are three basic ways to take advantage of each engulfing candlestick pattern.<br>
With the Bearish engulfing candlestick pattern:<br>
1.We can buy a Put option at the close of the second candlestick. If there is an increase in volume accompanying the large downward move, this will be a stronger sign to buy a Put in our binary options trading. Even if we are trading with binary options, the volume will be an important indicator in our technical analysis; a volume increase is a strong confirmation that the increase/decrease of the price is "real".<br>
2.We can buy a Put option the on the next period of the bearish engulfing candlestick occurs .This will of course  have a lower risk than the previous choice.<br>
3.Wait for other signals/confirmation before entering the trade with a Put option, for example, a break of the prices below a support area.<br>
With the Bullish engulfing candlestick pattern:<br>
1.We can buy a Call option at the close of the second candlestick. A considerable increase in volume at the same time and the large upward move takes place will be a stronger signal to buy a Call in our binary options trading.<br>
2.We can buy a Call option at the next period after the bearish engulfing candlestick occurs. This will of course imply a lower risk than the previous choice.<br>
3.Wait for other signals/confirmation before entering the trade with a Call option, for example, a break of the prices above a resistance area.<br>
