	<h3>48 HOURS PAYOUT</h3>
	<p>Chances are that you have never had trouble making deposits with a binary options broker. No broker has a problem accepting your money. The process is extremely smooth and efficient, and some brokers will even have their staff personally dedicate themselves to making sure the money finally enters your trading account with the broker.</p>
	<p>Problems set in when it comes to making withdrawals of profits or whatever is left after an unsuccessful trading streak.</p>
<p> As we said before, choosing a binary options broker with a safe and fast withdrawal process is crucial. Since there are over 2000 brokers out there, there are also a number of scam brokers. Choose the right broker for you and don't lose faith in the field by having a bad experience with the wrong kind of broker.

	<h3>We at BTX guarantee your withdrawal request will be processed within 48 hours!</h3>
	
	<p> When you have entered the amount that you want to withdraw, you will have to select a payment method. After this, all you have to do is confirm your withdrawal request. Then your request will be evaluated and processed and generally the processing time is within 24 to 48 hours,</p> 

    <p>Even though we at BTX have few different types of deposit and withdrawal methods, we highly recommend OKPAY .OKPAY is an international e-wallet service and a shopping cart interface and payment processing service. We can assure you a fast withdrawal without hassle when you use this option for deposit and withdrawal`</p>
