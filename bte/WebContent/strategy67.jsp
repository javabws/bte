	<h3>67. Moving Average Trend Confirmation</h3>
	<p>Popular amongst scalper and swing traders, a 1 Minute strategy allows binary options traders the opportunity to place a high probability trade approximately 50 times per day. Primarily used for trading currency pairs which oscillate within a tight trading range, the 1 Minute strategy is considered ideal for traders of all levels of experience.
	To successfully identify a high probability trade setup, the first point of action for a 1 Minute binary options trader is to confirm the trend. That is, the general direction of a market or of the price of an asset; either upward, downward or sideways.
	Used to help cut down the amount of "noise" on a price chart and as a general rule, if price is above the Moving Average line the trend is up. If the price is below the Moving Average line the trend is down. When price crosses over the Moving Average line, a trend reversal is anticipated.
	A bullish crossover occurs when price crosses above a Moving Average from below. The crossover signifies that a correction on the downtrend is over and an uptrend is possibly commencing.
	Conversely, a bearish crossover occurs when price crosses below a Moving Average from above and signals a potential change in uptrend direction and the imminent commencement of a downtrend.
	Typically, a 1 Minute binary options trader will use a 200-period Moving Average for trend identification, and a short-term Moving Average (such as a 50-period) crossover to generate trading signals.</p>

	<h4>Confirmation Indicator: Relative Strength Index</h4>
	<p>Because binary options traders are not concerned with how much an asset moves in price, only the direction, for a Moving Average price crossover strategy to be considered high probability, a trader should employ the use of a momentum indicator for signal confirmation. (NOTE: Opposing signals may indicate that the Moving Average signal is less reliable and the trader should exercise caution when pursuing the trade).
	Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator which measures the speed and change of price movements by comparing the size of recent gains to recent losses over a given period in an attempt to determine overbought and oversold conditions. As an independent indicator, when the RSI approaches 70 it is considered to be overbought and signals a sell trade. Conversely, when the RSI approaches 30, it is considered to be oversold and a buy trade is generated.</p>
	<h4>Measuring Volatility</h4>
	<p>Used to confirm price action behavior, a 1 Minute binary options trader can measure volatility to generate high probability trading opportunities. Most typically, volatility technical indicators, Average True Range and Bollinger Band Width as well as High Minus Low (for trend confirmation), give traders confirmation signals for profitable trading.</p>

	<h4>Price Chart Setup</h4>
	<p>Using 1-minute price bars, a 60 second binary options trader will use a 200-period Moving Average to confirm the direction of the prevailing price trend with a 50-period Moving Average crossover to generate trading signals. A 14-period (default period) RSI indicator is employed for signal confirmation.
When the 50-period Moving Average crosses above the 200-period Moving Average, a Call trade is generated. For the trade to be confirmed, the RSI must be above 50 signaling an upward trend which is (even) strengthened further if price action is above the Moving Average.

	<p>When the 50-period Moving Average crosses below the 200-period Moving Average, a Put trade is generated. For trade confirmation, the RSI must be below 50 signaling a downward trend which is (even) strengthened further if price action is below the Moving Average.</p>
