	<h3>92. Candlestick- The Hanging Man</h3>
	<p>This candlestick pattern is similar to the hammer but it will provide us with a strong bearish signal(that needs to be confirmed with other indicators/tools/previous periods candlestick patterns).This formation can be found at the top of an uptrend(most of the time),and will indicate a potential trend reversal/change in price's direction, as you can see in the following example:</p>
	<img src="images/strategy/str156.jpg">
	<p>This pattern shows us that the open, high and close prices of the session are almost the same .The only difference between the hammer and the hanging man formation, besides the opposite signal they provide, is that the hammer appears in a downtrend and the hanging man in an uptrend. 
	You can see this in the following picture:</p>

	<p>In those cases where the high and open prices are the same, the strength of the hanging man will be superior to the hanging man formations where the high and close are the same.

If we are following an uptrend that has been going on for a long time and a hanging man appears, this will be indicating us that there was a hesitation and the prices dropped during the session. 
The bulls made a comeback and pushed the price near the open, but the bears tested the strength of the bulls .The next periods candle will determine if the trend has indeed ended and the price will suffer a reversal or if the bulls have the strength to resume the uptrend.
Let's clarify something, although the hanging man is a bearish signal of significative strength, this does not mean that in our binary options trading we should just buy a Put based on this indication alone. 
We need confirmation .Let's see an example: after a long uptrend we identify several signs of trend weakening, then a hanging man pattern appears and the next session candle creates a large bearish black candle; in this kind of situation, placing a Put will probably be a good idea (although we will need to consider several other factors in order to select an adequate expiration time for our option).
Make sure other technical tools are added in order to confirm higher percentage of successful trades.
