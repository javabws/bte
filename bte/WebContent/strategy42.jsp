	<h3>42. Trading The Chart Patterns - Flags</h3>
	<h4>How to identify the flag chart pattern and trade it?</h4>
	<p><b>Today's strategy is based on identifying flag patterns on the charts. We will take a look at some examples while following up with possible strategies that can derive from this particular pattern.</b></p>
	<p><b>Flags are a common occurrence in trend consolidation phases of the markets so you should be able to find plenty when exploring the 1 minute charts.</b></p>
	<h4>Flags</h4>
	<p>You find small flags in a fast moving price trend, one that connect several picks in a day. If the price moves down it will pause at the flag and then will continue the down trend after breakout. You need to pay attention because the price reversals abound, so you should wait for the breakout to take action.</p>
	<p>I expect flags to perform better by hitting their price targets more often, but since we are focusing on direction when trading binary options that's what we will be focusing on.</p>
	<h4>Upward/Downward Breakouts</h4>
	<p><b>So how does a flag look like and how to identify it on the chart? It represents a short sloping rectangle which is bounded by two parallel trend lines. Breakout is upward or downward if the flag is reversed.</b></p>
	<p><b>It generally represents two types of trading - a reversal or a continuation of the trend depending on which side of the flag is broken by the price action. In our particular example the pattern is broken to the downside and the trend continues.</b></p>

    <h4>Distinguishing between flags</h4>
	<p>Tall and wide flags perform better than short and narrow ones. Patterns with a falling volume trend or light breakout volume perform better. Our chart shows a good example of a flag above. It is bounded by two parallel trend lines and usually is less than 3 hours long (often as short as 1 hour)</p>
	<p>You generally see these formations appearing in strong uptrend or downtrends (such as that shown in the example), usually near the halfway point in the move. This particular flag goes against the grain in the sense that prices rise in a downtrend.</p>
	<p>This is the most common behavior-a retrace in a downtrend-but it is not unusual for flags to appear horizontally (as short rectangles) or slope downward (following the trend). Since flags can also appear in an uptrend, they usually slope downward, but can be horizontal or slope upward too.</p>
	<h4>How to trade the flag pattern</h4>
	<p>In order to produce a trade one has to identify a break of the pattern to either side of the formation. On the example chart the formation is broken to the downside once you observe this you should start selling puts </p>
