	<h3>98. Candlestick -Piercing Line Pattern</h3>
	<p>This candlestick pattern provides us with a bullish reversal pattern signal. This pattern has two components: a bearish candle representing a trading period session, and a bullish candle representing the next period trading session. The bullish candle closes below the middle of the first candle (below 50%).The price gaps up on the following period ,but in the end fills the gap and close into the loses of the previous period. This rejection is a bullish signal ,and the retracement into the previous period loses adds more strength to it.
