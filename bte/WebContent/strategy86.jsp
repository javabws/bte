	<h3>86. Breakout Strategy</h3>
	<p>Another favorite of the 60 second strategies is trading breakouts since they are easy to detect and can generate impressive returns. The key idea of this method is that, if the price of an asset has been oscillating for some extensive time within a restricted range, then when it does attain enough momentum to breakout it frequently travels in its chosen direction for some considerable time.</p>
	<img src="images/strategy/str149.jpg">
	<p>Your initial step in implementing this technique is to identify an asset pair that has been fluctuating within a confined range for an extensive time period. As such, you are searching for a side-way trading pattern that is clearly delineated by a bottom and top, as demonstrated on the above  60 seconds charting diagram. Very often, price will bounce against its floor and ceiling numerous times before finally breaking free, as illustrated again on the above figure. A sustained breakout should subsequently be assessed as a strong recommendation to initiate a new trade.
	As the diagram above shows, the asset price does attain a clear breakout beneath its support or floor. You are now recommended to wait until the current 60 seconds candlestick is fully formed so that you can confirm that its closing value is undeniably below the bottom level of the previous trading range. This verification will provide you with some protection against a false signal.
	After accomplishing this objective, you should now open a new 'PUT' binary option based on the  60 seconds expiry period. As this form of trading is definitely dynamic, do not risk in excess of 2% of your equity per position. If your equity is $10,000, then your bet should be just $200. Your opening price is 1.0385; your payout  is 90% and .
	After the one minute expiry time elapses, the price stands at 1.0375; you are 'in-the-money' and collect $180.</p>
		<p><b>Please take note that most of these systems will only make money with BTX 60 seconds time frame which is a 90% payout. Trade among traders and eliminate the brokers</b></p>
