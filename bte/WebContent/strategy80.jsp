	<h3>80. Buying when everyone is selling/selling when everyone is buying</h3>
	<p>Trading financial markets is not an easy thing to do and before taking a trading decision one should consider both technical and fundamental factors, as well as micro and macro economic analysis.
	Anything can move markets, starting with an earthquake, the result of an election or economic news that is released based on the economic calendar.</p>
	<h4>Finding Opportunities in the Market</h4>
	<p>All the above is creating an environment in which markets are moving and the job of a trader is to look for opportunities in these markets, namely to buy lower values and sell at higher prices, or the sell at higher prices and close the position at lower levels. The result is called profit. In the case of binary options trading, when buying call options one is expecting for price to move to the upside and put options imply price is moving to the downside after the option is bought.
	Trading environment is a special one because out of the whole market, in the financial market, for example, the most popular product for binary options trading, the retail part consists of only 5% of the whole market, rest being large institutional investors and major players, banks, commercial and national, etc. Out of those 5%, 95% of people are losing money and only the rest are profitable. How is that possible and how to overcome this cruel aspect?</p>
	<h4>Indicators to Identify Overbought or Oversold Levels</h4>
	<p>One way is to do things differently like the rest of the people and trading with indicators gives this opportunity. Indicators, and especially oscillators, are showing so-called overbought and oversold levels. However, the whole market knows when an indicator shows a currency pair for example is overbought or oversold, and yet the vast majority is still losing money.
	The answer is to try to find strength in overbought territory and weakness in oversold ones as that is when markets are moving faster and more aggressive. Chances for an option to expire in the money is you buy in the overbought territory are way higher than if you're buying in oversold territory.</p>
	<p><b>Please take note that most of these systems will only make money with BTX 60 seconds time frame which is a 90% payout. Trade among traders and eliminate the brokers</b></p>
