	<h3>100% SAFE TRADE</h3>
	<p>A segregated fund, or segregated account, is an account used by a brokerage firm to keep the customers' assets separate from the firm's. If a brokerage house becomes insolvent, the customers' funds will be readily recognizable and will not be tied up in litigation for extended periods of time.</p>

<p>An important advantage of trading with a BTX is the total segregation of client funds from company funds. We will bank our customers' funds in segregated accounts, totally separate from company operating accounts.</p>

<h3>At BTX your hard earned money is always safe and secure. </h3>
<p>BTX  keeps client funds in a totally segregated on-shore bank account, and customer funds are never combined with other company funds, this means that even if all of our customers ask to withdraw their funds at the same time, the funds are always available.</p>

<p> As a result BTX guarantees processing all requests for withdrawals within 48 hours as the funds are always available in segregated accounts.</p>

<p>Another important factor to be considered here, with a traditional binary option brokers a "run on the bank" can occur when all customers ask to withdraw simultaneously and the funds to cover these debts simply do not exist due to any number of shady business practices such as a company using the deposits from one customer to pay the withdrawals of another, or otherwise using customer funds to simply run the day to day operating costs of their businesses, whereas  it is very unlikely for this situation to happen in BTX because we do not pay the winnings from our pocket. Trader A and Trader B place the trade. One of them will win obviously, so the winner will be paid from their own pool minusing our 10% commission!
