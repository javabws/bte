	<h3>95. Candlestick-Harami</h3>
	<p>The harami is a Japanese candlestick pattern and it can be bullish/bearish .It appears after a uptrend/downtrend and indicates a price reversal. Here you can see an example:</p>
	<img src="images/strategy/str162.jpg">
	<p>1.The bearish Harami: this pattern's element  are a large bullish white candle and a smaller bearish black candle after it .The smaller candle should be vertically "inside" the previous candle range(body and wicks).It's a sign of uncertainty in the markets.
	2.The bullish Harami: this pattern's element  are a large bearish black candle and a smaller bullish white candle after it. The smaller candle should be vertically inside the previous candle range(body and wicks).It's a sign of uncertainty in the markets.
	In our trading with binary options, we could get a Call signal if the price rose higher and closes above the downward resistance trend line .If we have a bullish harami pattern combined with trend break this will result in a strong Call signal.
	If the next period a bearish harami the price falls down and closes below the support line, this is a good chance to acquire a Put option.
	When they are combined, a bearish harami pattern and a trend break, it will make an even stronger bearish signal, so we can take advantage of this situation buying a Put option.
	The expiration times, as I said in the previous sections,will depend on several other factors.
	The Harami pattern can be very useful in our trading with binary options, and is used by many traders. The relevance and reliability of a harami will be much greater if it appears in a support/resistance area.
