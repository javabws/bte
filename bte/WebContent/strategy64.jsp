	<h3>64. 60 Second Strategy Using Andrew's Pitchfork</h3>
	<p>Developed by Dr Alan Andrews, Andrews' Pitchfork consists of three parallel lines usually drawn from three consecutive major peaks or troughs. The three parallel lines formed by Andrews' Pitchfork can help predict channels of support and resistance in a trending market and identify breakout points in the price channels making it an ideal tool for a high probability 60 Second traders.
60 Second Strategy Using Andrew's Pitchfork
Using a chart with 1 minute price bars, in an uptrend, Andrews Pitchfork can be drawn by first selecting the swing (or trend) low. This line acts as the Median Line. The reaction high and reaction low (also known as pivot points) are identified forming the pitchfork trend-lines.
In an uptrend, the lower trend line acts as support to define the overall trend and in high probability trading, the median line offers resistance while also defining the strength of the short term trend. Prices should reach the median line on a regular basis during an uptrend. Failure to reach this line shows underlying weakness that could foreshadow a trend reversal.
In high probability trades, short term traders look for breaks in support (or resistance levels), clean breaks which signal trend reversals and lower (or upper) trigger line breaches to act as call (buy) and put (sell) trading signals.
Because binary options traders are not concerned with how much an asset moves in price, only the direction the 60 Second Strategy using Andrews' Pitchfork is highly effective in identifying short term price movements for profitable high frequency trading.</p>
