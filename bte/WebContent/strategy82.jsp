	<h3>82. Fibonacci confluence areas</h3>
	<p>Fibonacci number areas very useful in trading as all trading platforms are offering the Fibonacci levels. Beside the Retracement tool, there are the Fibonacci Expansion, Time zones, and even arcs and other levels.
However, they are all based on the same sequence and the projected levels are nothing but important support/resistance areas that start from the most important level, the golden ratio (61.8%), and move into secondary levels as well. When looking at confluence areas, the term should be clearly understood in the sense that market is showing a stronger area to be broken if such a confluence of factors are coming in the same place.
I am talking in our case about Fibonacci levels of different wave degrees that are around the same level. Elliott waves without Fibonacci it is simply not working and the fact that we can play with different degrees in terms of the waves structure but keeping in the same time the Fibonacci levels for the pattern we're trading allows us to find strong support and resistance areas. This in turn translates into great striking prices when trading binary options.
