	<h3>93. Candlestick-Shooting Star </h3>
	<p>The shooting star is a Japanese candlestick formation that indicates us a potential bearish reversal of the prices. This pattern has a long upper shadow and no lower wick, or a very short one, as you can see in the next picture:</p>
	<img src="images/strategy/str158.jpg">
	<p>The real body is small and close to the the lows of the session. The long upper wick indicates that the market tested the prices to find a resistance area .When this resistance area was found, the sellers began to push the prices lower, ending the session near the opening price.
The strength of the shooting star will vary; when the low and close prices are the same, we will have a stronger shooting star than when the open and low of the shooting star are almost the same value .In this last situation the shooting star pattern will be considered less bearish, but still bearish (the sellers countered the buyers, but were not able to bring the price at the open level).
The shooting star pattern will help us to see the location of the resistance level .If it appears after a long uptrend and our indicators/tools were indicating us a progressive weakening of the trend in the previous sessions, the chances of a reversal of the prices are high .If the next session's candle is a long bearish black candle, this will increase even more the chances of a reversal, so we could buy a Put in our binary options trading.</p>

	<p>As I said about the previous candlestick patterns ,although they can be very useful, we should always confirm the signals they provide us and not base our trading decisions on them.</p>
