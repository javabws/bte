	<h3>3. Follow Trend Strategy</h3>
	<p>Another of the 60 second strategies that has gained in popularity recently is based on tracking trends. This is because such strategies allows the binary options trader to exploit the advantage of trading with the trend and, as such, comply with the well-known maxim which states that the 'trend is your friend'.  The basic idea is to trail a trend and execute a 'CALL' binary option if price ricochets higher from the lower trend line when the underlying security is climbing within a well-established bullish passage. In contrast, you should activate PUT binary options whenever price rebounds downwards after hitting the upper trend line in a well-defined bearish channel.</p>
	<p><img src="images/strategy/stra3.jpg"></p>
	<p>For example, the above 1 minute trading chart for the  currency pair clearly displays a strong bearish trend. As you can confirm from studying this diagram, four opportunities for opening PUT options arose after price rebounded lower against the upper trend line.</p>
	<p>To instigate a trending strategy, you must first locate an asset that has been trading either a bullish or bearish trend for some time. You then need to draw the trendlines by connecting the series of lower highs for the upper trendline and the lower lows for the lower trendline in the case of a bearish channel, as illustrated on the above chart.</p>
	<p>Once you observe price testing the upper trendline, then you should pause until the current candlestick completely forms so that you can verify that it closes beneath this level. If it does, then initiate a new PUT option using  as its underlying asset with the 1 minute expiry time. Envisage that your wager is $1,000 and the payout is 90%. The four successful trades identified on the above chart would have netted you a staggering $13,000  in just over 2 hours if you reinvested your profits each time. Now, you can begin to understand why so many traders are raving about 60 second binary options.</p>
	<p><b>Please take note that most of these systems will only make money with BTX 60 seconds time frame which is a 90% payout. Trade among traders and eliminate the brokers.</b></p>
