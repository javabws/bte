	<h3>17. Support And Resistance Rebound Strategy</h3>
	<p>This is a relatively new options type, which is already used by both novice and experienced traders. With its help, you can make a profit in just a minute after the investment. The main advantage of the strategy is the short duration of 60 seconds, which allows traders to apply some risk minimizing strategies.</p>
	<h4>How to perform this 60 seconds strategy?</h4>
	<p>You just need to wait for signs of clear trends - when the curve steadily goes up or down. Such a trend often appears when the market falls or after financial news publication.</p>
	<h4>You need to invest in accordance with the behavior of the curve - choose Call - when the curve goes up or Put - when the curve is directed downwards.</h4>
	<p>Since 60 seconds options usually expire faster than the trend reverses, you can significantly increase your budget for a few minutes.</p>
	<p>You should invest in 60 seconds options only in the case of a strong trend.</p>
	<p>Typically, such trends do not last very long or in other words from a few up to 10 minutes frames, depending on the asset and the market situation. Anyway it will be enough to make some good amount of money.</p>
	<h4>Using support and resistance for 60 seconds trading</h4>
	<p>Since catching the trends while trading 60 seconds options can be as risky as trying to catch a wave while surfing, you can use the support and resistance lines as an auxiliary tool. 60 seconds binary options strategy can bring good profits even by using this simple analysis.</p>
	<p>Once you see the formation of a new line of support or resistance, and the price touches the line and turns - just invest in the direction of the turn.</p>

	<p>Familiar for many traders Head and Shoulders pattern can also be useful for such short time intervals. Once you see a full forming pattern or the time when the price breaks the neckline, you can safely invest according to the price direction.</p>
	<p><b>Please take note that most of these systems will only make money with BTX 60 seconds time frame which is a 90% payout. Trade among traders and eliminate the brokers.</b></p>
