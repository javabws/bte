	<h3>74. Precise Entry - binary options trading strategy</h3>
	<p>In order to trade binary options more effectively, traders often use strategy called Precise entry. Such a strategy would suggest the most appropriate time to enter the market, and help to determine the correct direction. Precise entry strategy leaves the possibility of experimentation.
Selection of different criteria can significantly improve the strategy. For example, for greater accuracy, you can add it to use Fibonacci levels. With the use of this technical analysis part it will be available to detect the last oscillation. This will provide an opportunity to avoid even a small rollback, and increase the accuracy of determining when to enter the market.
Such a strategy is implemented with some instruments, and has a number of requirements. Below is a list of tools and requirements for the use of the strategy:<br>
1.Trade can be implemented in any time frame .<br>
2.Trade can be made using any currency pair.<br>
3.Simple Moving Average with a periodicity of 150.<br>
4.Stochastic Oscillator or stochastic (6,3,3), horizontal lines 70 and 30.<br>
5.RSI or Relative Strength Index with the frequency of 3 with horizontal lines 80 and 20.<br>
You must use the following guidelines in order to determine the correct time of entry. When the trend is growing and the price is above the 150 SMA, you must expect a level crossing indicator RSI 20 in a downward direction, and the confirmation signal, the third in a row. This signal is the intersection of Stochastic. A signal will be given when the two intersecting stochastic lines will be below 30. Only after the implementation of all of the above you can purchase call binary option. And you can purchase a binary option for a long time.
When a trend starts to descend, and the price will be below the simple moving average (SMA), you need to wait until 80 level crossings occur. The indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) crosses this level from the bottom up. It must be established when both stochastic lines cross above the level of 70. If all parameters are filled, it's time to buy short-term put binary option.
