	<h3>43. Trading The Euro</h3>
	<h4>Fundamental factors behind the Euro price</h4>
	<p><b>In this strategy session we are embarking on a rather difficult task. We will introduce you to what economic data releases are, and how do they affect currency movements.</b></p>
	<p><b>We will dive down into a glimpse of the Euro Zone indicators with some examples of potential market moving news.</b></p>
	<p><b>Whilst news trading is not very easy, a trader that is interpreting the news correctly most certainly will be more profitable than the rest. Let's take a close look at the news that affect binary options prices in the Euro currency. </b></p>
	<h4>Euro Zone</h4>
	<p>For the purpose of this analysis we will be taking a look at the EUR/USD pair since the most important of economic events in the currencies markets are being released either in the Euro Zone or in the USA. In further articles we will also pay some special attention to Japan, as their policy is really extraordinary right now.</p>
	<p>As you might know the "guardians" of any currency are the central bankers - they are responsible for keeping the currency valuable without letting it depreciate at a rampant rate. They need to strike a balance between inflation and not to tighten the economy too much with high interest rates.</p>
	<h4>Purchasing Managers Indices</h4>
	<p>So let's take a look at Europe first and the most important economic events released during the month. Every month starts with the Manufacturing and Services PMI data for the separate countries forming the Euro Zone and the number as a whole.</p>
	<p>A PMI survey stands for Purchasing Managers Survey - any number above 50 means that activity in the sector is expanding, any number below it signifies contraction in the sector and hence in the GDP growth number.</p>
	<p>This data point is released every first Tuesday and Thursday of the month for Manufacturing and Services respectively. Preliminary data is released in the previous week with indicative results that are not taking into account full results from the survey data. For example today's data from France was very rather higher than expected, which sent the Euro to a session high of 1.3080 only to drop sharply on the release of German data all the way down to 1.2972.</p>
	<h4>Unemployment and GDP</h4>
	<p>For example - Germany reports its first quarter (which ended in March) numbers in the middle of May. Then they release a second number in the end of June to confirm the accuracy of the first estimate, and finally in July we have a final number which is more or less procedural and doesn't interest traders which by that time are looking at GDP data for the Second quarter.</p>
	<h4>Business Surveys</h4>-
	<p>This brings us to a point - it is very important to know which data is backward looking and which one is forward looking. Backward looking data is unemployment, industrial production, money supply, factory orders, and trade balance. Forward looking data are the PMI's, business activity surveys, the first GDP report and of course the monetary policy meetings of the European Central Bank. Lets' cover the business surveys data points.</p>
	<p>With Germany being the biggest economy in the euro zone, its business activity surveys are the most important ones. Special attention is paid to the monthly published ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment. It is a leading indicator for the German economy compiled by The Centre for European Economic Research (Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung or ZEW). The survey also asks for the expectations for the Euro zone, Japan, Great Britain, Italy, France and the US.</p>
	<p>The second most important one is conducted by the IFO Institute for Economic Research which is a Munich-based research institution. IFO is an acronym from Information and Forschung (research). Both of these surveys are released once a month and constitute future expectation for growth in the major European economic powerhouse in the face of Germany.</p>
	<h4>Inflation Rate</h4>
	<p>Last but not least we will pay attention to the way European authorities measure their inflation rate. It is called the HICP (Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices) and the higher it goes, the more likely is for the European Central Bank to move interest rates to stabilize it. The HICP is released once a month and every number above 2% on a year on year basis is likely to trigger some moods in the central bank to raise interest rates, which in turn should raise the value of the Euro. So the higher this number is, the higher the Euro is likely to go. Since we got to this point it is inevitable to switch our attention to the culmination of every month in the Euro trade.</p>
	<h4>ECB Press Conference</h4>
	<p>The Governing Council of the ECB meets every first Thursday of the month to decide on current and future course of monetary policy. The higher the interest rates the higher the Euro's value is, however it is critical to understand that the most important part of this decision is the press conference that takes place after it. The President of the ECB Mario Draghi speaks at 12:30 GMT after the release of the policy decision at 11:45 GMT every first Thursday of the month.</p>
	<h4>We will observe this trading idea in greater detail as the ECB meeting comes near, but for now it is important for you to consider that these are the main Euro moving factors</h4>
