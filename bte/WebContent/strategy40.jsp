	<h3>40. Fibonacci Strategy for short term trading</h3>
	<p>Learn Fibonacci basics and how to draw Fib lines. Check out my trading examples on EUR/USD and find out how to execute more successful Call/Put trades using the price trends.</p>
	<h4>Fibonacci Basics</h4>
	<p>The name comes from the famous Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci who developed a sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233...</p>
	<p>21 + 34 = 55; 55 + 89 = 144</p>
	<p>Meaning that each next number is equal to the sum of the previous two.</p>
	<p>The Fibonacci retracement is calculated by dividing the higher numbers in the sequence:</p>
    <p>55/89 = 61.797%, 89/144 = 61.805%</p>
    <p>In trading the Fibonacci retracement is simply a drawing tool which separates the chart in the following levels: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50,0% and 61.8%.</p>
    <h4>The key level to be monitored on your chart is 61.8%.</h4>
    <h4>Essence of the strategy</h4>
    <p>The idea is to locate a trend on the chart (up or down) and pullback (retracement) after which the trend will continue in the same direction. You have to enter the market at the pullback with a Call or a Put option depending on the trend Up or Down.</p>
    <p>You need to draw the Fibonacci lines in the direction of the move in order to locate the retracement - the point where you trade.</p>
    <p>In an uptrend you draw the Fib lines form the Lowest to Highest point of the trend and the opposite way for a downtrend.</p>
    <p>When you are using the Fib tool your aim is to define at which level the price action will stall. Ideally the retracements will start on the 50.0% Fib level or even better on the 61.8% level.</p>
    <h4>Examples</h4>
    <p>In the following examples I am trading EUR/USD in short term options: 5 minutes.</p>
    <h4>Uptrend</h4>
    <p><img src="images/strategy/stra40.jpg"></p>
    <p>You see a clear uptrend where I am drawing the Fib lines from Low to High.</p>
    <p>100,0% level is on Low where EUR/USD price is near 1,35160</p>
    <p>There is a small pullback on the 61.8 level which can be entered with a Call option after which follows a confirmation at the 50.0 where I started to buy Call options. The price move dropped first to the 61.8 level then to 50.0 and continued its move in the direction of the trend.</p>
    <h4>Downtrend</h4>
    <p><img src="images/strategy/stra400.jpg"></p>
    <p>100,0% level is on High where EUR/USD price is near 1,35940</p>
    <p>You can see on the chart there are two pullbacks on the 50.0 level. I took the second one as a confirmation for a retracement after which the trend made a strong move to the downside. In such a case when you have a confirmation you can continue buying  Put options on the pair.</p>
    <h4>To be successful on this strategy</h4>
    <p>- Trade highly volatile markets </p>
    <p>- Get some experience with the Fib tool so that you are able to find the 61.8% level just by eyeing it</p>
    <p>- Set up your chart time frames according to the expiries that you trade</p>
    <h4>These are the basics of Fibonacci retracements so you can expect more articles to come on this subject. I hope this strategy will be useful for your binary trades </h4>
