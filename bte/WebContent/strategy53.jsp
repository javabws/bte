	<h3>53. Nadars  Strategy using investing.com</h3>
	<p>Unique system for trading options
You can consistently earn and reduce your risk to a minimum.
Let's recall that with options trading we need to predict, or guess, if the price of the asset will be up or down. How do we do that? We read the news, looking for the most important items that can increase the volatility of our asset. We analyze the schedule and then decide up or down
Our broker also analyzes the market, reads the news and reacts. Often, some brokers on the eve of the release of important news that could affect the volatility decrease the payout percentage. At times we can't even buy the option due to buffering. What does this mean for us?
Sometimes, it seems we did everything right and even correctly predicted, and the price was moving the right way but we are stopped by the brokers deliberately. At the result, we just wasted money. Even if we can make a profit, this is rare; the news isn't constant, and we want trade all the time. 
	</p>
	<p><b>What do we do?</b></p>
	<p>With BTX you have no worries because we are an exchange and it is a peer to peer trading. We encourage winners unlike other brokers.
It's hard to guess how the price will react to news; it will react, but how it can that be shown on charts. Sometimes, the price needs just two or three points to break the range, and these two or three points can cost us our money.
Let's consider the example of  options trading with broker BTX. On BTX, select an option. Go directly to the asset. I suggest choosing the asset GBP/USD. Now go to the well-known site investing.com and look for options trading signals.

	<p>The technical indicator signals tell us "strong buy," so the market expects important news, which can affect the price and break the range.
Make sure all summary shows a strong buy or a strong sell.
As per the example above , a strong buy is indicated on the GBP/USD pair. You may place CALL  at this point and 85% of time you will be right!
This Nadars Strategy is a unique and powerful system which can make you a lot of money!

	<p><b> Please take note that most of these systems will only make money with BTX 60 seconds time frame which is a 90% payout. Trade among traders and eliminate the brokers</b></p>
