	<h3>9. Awesome Oscillator Call Signals</h3>
	<p>Typically, the software will turn the bar green, which is above the previous column. Bars of the histogram, which are lower than the previous ones, are colored in red. This makes it very easy to observe the change in the force.</p>
	<p>Bill Williams has identified three possible options for Call and another three for Put signals that Awesome Oscillator provides.</p>
	<h4>Saucer Call Signal</h4>
	<p><img src="images/strategy/stra9.jpg"/></p>
	<p>Saucer, this is the only Call signal that comes when the bar chart of Awesome Oscillator is above the zero line. For the formation of Saucer, at least three bars of the histogram are necessary.</p>
	<p>Saucer is generated when the bar chart reverses its direction from downward to upward, i.e., first bar value is greater than the second, second have lower value than first (red bar), third is more than the second (green bar).</p>
	<p>In this case, all the bars of Awesome Oscillator histogram should be above the zero line.</p>
	<h4>Intersection of the Zero Line Call signal</h4>
	<p><img src="images/strategy/stra99.jpg"/></p>
	<p>This Call signal is generated when the histogram of Awesome Oscillator goes from negative to positive values. It occurs when the histogram crosses the zero line. If there is crossing of the zero line Call signal, histogram bar will always be green.</p>
	<h4>Twin peaks Call Signal</h4>
	<p><img src="images/strategy/stra999.jpg"/></p>
	<p>This Call signal is generated when you have a pike pointing down (the lowest minimum) located below the zero line of the indicator, followed by another downward peak, which is higher (a negative value, the smaller the absolute value, so it is closer to zero) than the previous peak, down-looking.</p>
	<p>The histogram should be below the zero line between the two peaks. If the histogram crosses zero line between the peaks, the Call signal is not valid.</p>
	<p><b>Please take note that most of these systems will only make money with BTX 60 seconds time frame which is a 90% payout. Trade among traders and eliminate the brokers.</b></p>
