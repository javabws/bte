	<h3>72. Budget Management Strategy</h3>
	<p>Investment management in binary options is one of the most important components of a successful strategy in binary option trading. Just like in our daily lives, a reasonable cash management is very important in trading. Binary options are positioned in the market as a simpler version of FX trading suitable for beginners and professionals, as well as providing an opportunity not only to trade currencies, but other exchange of assets also - stocks, indices and commodities.
	But in spite of such differences and simplicity, binary option trading requires a strategic approach to the process and discipline. With the ability to get a quick result, binary option trading has a major threat: such a tempting opportunity as quick profits can easily drown out the rational approach and then the emotions and excitement are sure to prevail.
	Here are some tips to help you develop your own strategy for binary option trading and money management when trading:
	</p>
	<h4>Strategy 50%</h4>
	<p>When you start trading, never risk more than 50% of the profit made. So after the binary option will bring your first profit - share it in half: 50% set aside, and 50% invest further in trading. 
	This way you will always have to take profits, which will remain with you, even if the next trade will fail, but at the expense of the other 50%, you will gradually increase the amount of your investment in proportion to this your payments for winning options will increase.
	On the one hand, applying this strategy to trade, you will earn less than you could, putting all the money earned in a turn, but on the other, which is very important - using this strategy, you minimize your risks and you will always have capital with which you can continue trading.
